Step 1
Let the side length of the hexagon be $r$. Draw a line from the intersection of AB and CB, intersecting side QR at point $\Delta$. This is a straight line, but it is also the perpendicular bisector of the angle between the perpendicular bisector of $\angle Q$. Thus, the perpendicular from point C to QR bisects angle $Q$, and the area enclosed by triangles $\triangle PQR$ and $\Delta$ are identical.

Step 2
Let point D lie on the QR at the angle bisector of angle $\angle Q$. Since the perpendicular from point C to QR bisects angle $Q$ and divides the triangle into two identical triangles, as $\Delta$ shares a side with $\Delta$, it follows that it has to be the same. This is possible only if $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles since $AD=BD$.

Step 3
Since $[ABC]+[\triangle PQR]=\frac{1}{2} r^2\times 1=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1^2= \frac{1}{2}$ and the area $\Delta[PQR]$ is given by $\frac{1}{2}$ $(r \cos(75^{\circ})+r\cos(60^{\circ})+r\cos(60^{\circ})$.

Step 4
$\frac{\sin(60^{\circ})}{2}+r \cdot \cos(60^{\circ}) + \frac{1}{2} r \sin(60^{\circ})$

Step 5
$\sin(\frac{\pi}{3})$ and $\cos^2(\frac{\pi}{3})= \frac{1}{2} r=1+\frac{1}{2}$   $r = \frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{2}$   The required area equation now becomes $\frac{3}{4}+0.5 r\sqrt{3}$. Using the value of  r which was found, substitute, we get  $\frac{3}{4}+0.5 \cdot \frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Step 6
$\sqrt3$

Step 7
$\frac{3+  sqrt3}{4}$

By applying Ptolemy's Theorem, we get the relation $CDx+DP = PQ \implies (1)(2)+(1)(2+2\sqrt{3}) = PQ$ and further expanding the entire equation, we get $CD=3$.
Generated completion: <think> The regular hexagon is an equilateral triangle so we can rotate it by 30 degrees clockwise. Using the law of cosines, we get PQ^2 = PA^2 + PR^2 - 2*(PA*PR)*cos(theta) = 1^2 + 2 - 2*1*2*cos(30 degrees) = 5, which is not a perfect square - thus no solution exists. Since we have also the Law of sines applied to the triangle ABC (the formula gives us sin(PA/sin(theta)=sin(QB/sin(30))) which is equivalent to AB/2=cos(30). The area is (sqrt(3)/4)*AB*2*AB*sin(75 degrees) = sqrt(3). The equation now becomes sqrt(3)(sqrt(3)+1)/4 = 5, then by the quadratic formula we get sqrt(3)+1 = 4*sqrt(3), hence sqrt(3)/4 is an extraneous solutions. <answer> 3+3+4+3 = 13
Generated completion: <think> We begin by forming $\triangle ABC$. We set $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=1$ since they have integer sides. As $\triangle ABC$ is a regular hexagon, it also forms a regular triangle. As the angles of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle RPQ$ are complementary, we can calculate the third angle of $\triangle ABC$ to be $105^{\circ}$. Drawing the second line, we form  $\triangle PRQ$. This is a 105^{\circ}-75^{\circ},-60^{\circ}$ triangle, forming three angles 30-, 25-, and 40^{\circ}, as it is part of the interior of the regular hexagon. Therefore, we have a 30-60-90 right-angled triangle.
Generated completion: <think>The angles in triangle ABCD are 30°, 60°, 90°, 60°, and 30° as it's a regular hexagon. Hence, ABCD is equilateral triangle.</think> <answer>a=5, b=3, c=2, and d=2 </answer>

So, a = 5, b = 3, c = 2, and d = 2.

To add the numerator and the denominator to get the desired form a + b + c + d we first calculate their LCM. Since a = 5, b = 3, c =2 and d = 2, their LCM is 60.

5 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12
Generated completion: <think> To find the area of the triangle in the question, we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its side lengths. We know that the area of a triangle can also be expressed as, A = rs, where r is the inradius of the triangle, and s is the perimeter of the triangle. Therefore, from the formula mentioned above, the area of the triangle can be expressed as, A =  $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where a, b, c and d are positive integers. Now we need to find the side lengths a, b, c and d to be used to calculate, here a = (2+sqrt(3))/2, b = s, c = 2*sqrt(3) and d = 2

Since, AB + BD =  the perimeter of the triangle and, CD + AD = the perimeter of the triangle, we can equate these two perimeter equations, and solve for s, after simplification we find that s = 1. Therefore the area = (2+sqrt3)/2*1 which is equal to the given answer, <answer> 2+3+3+2 = 10 </answer>
Generated completion: <think> To find the area of $\triangle PQR$, we can use triangle $EBC$. Using $BC=1$, $\angle PEC=30^o$, which means $\angle CPE = 180^o-30^o-75^o=75^o$. With $\triangle PEC$ being equilateral, we have $EC=a$ and $PE=b$. Then by the law of cosines, the area of $\triangle PEC$ is $\frac{a^2\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This can be subtracted from the area of the triangle formed by $ABC$ to get the expression $d(\frac{4}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$. Hence $d$ must be 8. We must now divide the area of $\triangle PQR$ into four smaller triangles to find their individual areas. In doing so, we look for the 6 triangles which are each congruent $30-60-90^\circ$ triangles. In a $30-60-90^\circ$ triangle, the ratio of the side ratio is usually 1,$\sqrt{3},1$. The areas are found to be in the ratio of $1 : \sqrt{3} : 1$. We see that after dividing the triangle into four triangles, the area of each triangle has the ratio of $1 : \sqrt{3} : 1 : \sqrt{3} : 1 : 1$, and the only ratio satisfying this is $\frac{1}{2}: \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}: 1: \sqrt{3}: 2: 1$, so in this case $d=2$. Then by the given equations, we can calculate the area of $\triangle PQR$ as $\frac{a + b \sqrt{3}}{2}$. Now using Heron's formula, we can plug the length values $a=1, b=1, c=1, d=2$ and then set the result equal to $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$ to find that $\frac{1+1\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The solutions of this equation are  $1+1\sqrt{3}$ and $2+2\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the final answer is $1+1 +3+2 = \boxed{7}.$

Generated completion: ## Step 1
Given $\frac xy$ is an integer for any positive integer $x$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is also an integer, we need to find the ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ where $y<x\le100.$ We can first identify the cases where both conditions hold true. If $\frac xy$ is an integer for any $x,$ then $x$ must be a multiple of $y.$ Also, if $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer for any $x,$ then $x+1$ must be a multiple of $y+1.$

## Step 2
Let's analyze the first condition: $\frac xy$ is an integer. If $y$ divides $x,$ then $x = ky,$ where $k$ is an integer. If $y=1,$ $x$ can be any value, but for the second condition to be satisfied, this would result in a non-integer value of  $x+1.$ Therefore, for any $y>1,$ we have $x=k(y)$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}=k+1.$ If  $x=3k,$ this gives $k+1=\frac{3k}{y+1}$  for $(k,y)=($3,1),(6,2),(9,3),$ and $(12,4)$ which leads to $(x,y)=($3,1),(9,2),$ and $(15,3)$. So the potential (x),y pairs are ($3,1$),(6,2),(9,3),$ and (15,3). If $k=4,$ $x=4y$ which is not the condition for $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ being an integer, which is our case. Therefore, the potential pairs where the first condition holds and are greater than 1 are ($3,1$),(6,2),(9,3),$ and (15,3).

The second condition $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ being an integer means $y+1$ divides $x+1.$ There are infinitely many divisors of $x+1.$ Given that for $x$ ranging from 1 to 99, the values of $y+1$ that divide $x+1$ are 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5,$ and 8. Thus, there are 11 possible values for $y+1.$ Given that $y$ ranges from 2 to 99, there are 49 different $y$ values. Therefore, the total number of ways to find the possible values $y$ given that $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer is

## Step 3
Adding $y$ and $y+1$, we get: $2y+1 = 2(y+1)-1$. Solving this gives: we get

$y+1 -1 -1 = 2(y+1)$
So  $y + 1 - 1 - 1 = 2y + 1$
Which is equivalent to
$y+1 -1 = 2y$


Adding $1$ to both sides

$ y +1 = 2y$

Subtracting 1 from both sides

$ y = 1


## Step 4
Substituting these values of $y$ into $x=3y$, we get four possible values for $x$, namely, $x=3, 6, 9, 15.$ To find another solution for $x$, we must select one of the pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfies both conditions $y < 100$ and $\frac{(x+1)}{(y+1)}$ is an integer. Given all four pairs for $x$ that we have found and that $y$ must divide $x+1$ for $\frac{(x+1)}{(y+1}$ to be an integer, we see that only $(3,2)$ and $(9,3)$ should be considered. Evaluating for this pair, we see that

$\frac{(3+1)}{(2+1) = \frac{4}{3}$ does not result in an integer. Therefore, we can conclude that $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ requires more of $x$ than for $y+1$.

For every value of y, we need to check if the corresponding x can be an integer.

If  y =  2, 3, or 4,  x =3, then for  (x, y)=$3,2,$ we already determine that $\frac{x+1}{y+1} =  \frac{4}{3}$ is not an integer, so (3,2) is not valid.
Since we have already ruled out 2 solutions, we have 1 possible solution for (x, $y$ = 3,2 )  ($3 $= 3, 14,  17,$...

Now for each $y$ from 5 to 100, we compute $x+1$, and for those valid 14 numbers we know that $x+1$ is a $15, 16, 17,$...98, 99 $y$.


## Step 5
Let us analyze the $y$ values from 5 through 100, given that we have already determined that we know that one of the two possible  values is  3
We know that one of the values that satisfy the conditions is $14$,  because $x = 11$ and $y = 7$ because $\frac{11+1}{7+1 }$ is an integer, so then we have $14)$ <think>x $14)> $9 and $11$, and the number $10$; if $y = 11$, $x = 14$, we see that

x+1 = 15, and $\frac{15}{11+1}$ is not an integer.

## Step 6
Since we already ruled out that number, we can see that all of our values for x have been exhausted so we know that no value ($k$ exists) to use. Given this, our list should only be $x= 3$, $x=6$,$ x= 9,$ $x= 15.$ Thus there are 4 ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy the conditions.


The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$
Generated completion: <think> We can start by finding a way to generate those fractions with integers x and y such that x and y are both positive integers. A solution is clearly (x, y) = (6,5), (7,6). We can then check the values of (x+1) and (y+1) if x and y > 5. We can generate those fractions if we can find a way to find a divisor of xy and a factor of x +1. By writing xy as xy = k(x*2), we get x*2 = k. Since 2 is a factor of k, and y*7 = k, we can replace 2/x with z. Thus the answer is <answer> the possible ordered pairs are (6,5) and (7,6). </answer>
Generated completion: <think> We can write $x$ as $x = xy$, and substitute this into $\dfrac{x+1}{y+1}$ to get $\dfrac{xy +1} {y +1} =  \dfrac{y^2 + x} {y+1} = \dfrac{(xy) + 1 }{y+1}.$  Since this must be an integer, $(xy + 1)$ must be a factor of $y^2 + x.$  Therefore, $(y^2+x) = (y+1)(k)$ for some integer $k.$  Rearranging, we have $(y^2-x)y = k y + 1,$ or $(y^2 - k)y -1 = 0$ is a factor of $y( y - (k + 1)).$  However, $(y(y - k -1))$ is positive, $(k+1)>0$,  since $y>0$, so $y - k -1 > 0.$  Therefore, we need to have $(y - k) > 0$ so that $(y(y -  k -1)$ is positive. This leads to either $y > k.$  Now we have shown that we need $y > k$, and we need $(y+1)$ to divide $x$, which means that $y$ must be one more than a multiple of $k$ and therefore $y$ must be divisible by $k$ since then the $x$ will definitely be divisible by it when we use the fact that $(xy + 1) = k(y+1)$.  Then every divisor of $y$ that is greater than 1 will also be a divisor of $x$. Now consider the pairs of $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both divisors of $y$.  Since $y > k$, the list of possible pairs of $(x,y)$ is <think> the list of all the divisors of the numbers from 2 to $y $ </think> <answer> there are $y-k \ge 2 </answer> pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$ with the desired property, and <think> there are $y - k$ of those pairs, since when $y$ is divisible by $k$ then $x$ is also divisible by $k$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Understand the conditions
To find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ being integers with $y<x\le 100$, we first recognize that both expressions require their results to be integers.

## Step 2: Analyze the first condition
For $\frac xy$ to be an integer, $x$ must be divisible by $y$, and $y$ must be divisible by the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y.$

## Step 3: Analyze the second condition
For $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be an integer, the numerator $x+1$ must be divisible by the denominator $y+1.$

## Step 4: Identify a universal solution
Notice that if $\frac xy$ is an integer, then $y \mid (x-1)$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ must also be an integer.

## Step 5: Analyze the range of y
Because $y < x \leq 100,$ the range of $y$ values we can consider is more restrictive, since $y < \frac{100(x-1)}{x}$ (from the inequality $(y-1)x \geq 100x-y$ when $y < x \leq 100$).

## Step 6: List possible values of y
There are many possible values of $y$ that satisfy the inequality. Using list method, we start with $y = 2$ to  $y = 99.$ As the number of possible solutions increases, the range of values of y decreases.

## Step 7: Eliminate invalid cases
Since $\frac {x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer when $y+1$ divides $x+1$, in order to have $\frac {x$ be an integer $\frac {x+1}{y+1}$, then $x$ must be of such that when $(y+1)$ divides $(x+1)$. For $\frac{ xy}{y+1}$ also to be an integer $\frac{y}{y+1}$ must be of such that $(y+1)$ divides $(y+1)(x+1)=(xy+y)$

## Step 8: Identify solutions where x and y are of the same prime
Note that both  $x$ and $y = 2$ and  $x$ and $y = 2$ are not valid as the case needs to be checked both with these values, because in the original question we need  y  = <y  <  $$ x\ \leq 100 $$, so y  = 2 is a non valid

## Step 9: Find a possible values for (x-1)/y
If $x+1$ is divisible by $(y+1)$, if $x > 1$, $x-1 $ must be divisible by $(y+1)$. Since $x  \le 100, and both $x$ and $y-x+1$  1 $(x$ and $y$ has to be  positive) then  when y  \ equals  1, then no solutions, so y must  be greater than 1.

## Step 10: Determine the divisors for $(x+1)$ and $(y+1)$ using difference factorization:
The factor for $(x+1)$ can be defined using  $y+1=x/(y+1) * (y+2)$. As y+1  1 $(y =k(y+1)$ to find a possible value of (x). This is essentially equivalent to $$k=\frac{x+1}{y+2}$$  where $x+2 \le  100$

## Step 11: Use (y+2) from the y+1 equation, as y is greater than 1 for our condition to be true
For $y > 1$, substitute  $(x+2)$ in the inequality $x+2 \le 100 y$  $x+2  \le 100(y+2), $ and solve for x that $x \le 100y-100.$
$$ x \le 100y -100. $$

## Step 12: Generate the corresponding ordered $(x,y)$ as pairs where $(x-2) 0.10(y-1)$
To find the value of the y for which $(x-2)  0,1.$  substitute $y = 2(x-2) +1$ to $y=(x-2)(x-1)$. To get values of x = $n(x-2) 2.  (2 is a constant). So, (x-2) value increases at every value of x.

## Step 13: Generate and generate ordered pairs of ordered pairs where (x-2) < 2 and both y-1 > 0
Notice that, the number of possible $(x, y)$ pairs is limited based on increasing factors of (y-1), and given that both $x-2$ and  y is positive.

## Step 14: Consider $(x,y)$ pairs  $(6,7)$  $(8,9)$ $(10,11)$ as $y = 9$, 1
$(x,y)$ pairs that are less than $(y, 2)$ but that the corresponding $(x+1) $  $(2y+1)$ since y is an integer.

## Step 15: Consider $y =6$ to  $y =49$ to generate pairs that are within $(x-2) 2 $ and $(y-1$  $ (y-1 )$, the possible $(y-1)$ values are $1, 2,3,4, 5$

## Step 16: The sum of pairs is equal to  $3\cdot45=135$
$(x, y)$ pairs are given by the combination of possible pairs of factors of $(y - 1)$. Substituting the value of $(y) $ yields:

## Step 17: Calculate  the denominator $(y+1)$ as $11$ ($x=6$ to $x=49$).
The denominator $(y+1) $ as $11. x$ yields  $x = 6$. This yields $(x = 14 )$ and $(x = 25)$ pairs as 12 is not a factor ($y =7$  $x = 8) as  $(x, y)$ pairs given are $( x -2 0.1(y - 1)$ and both  x  are between $(y - 1 = 6)$ and $(y-1 9)$

## Step 18: Sum the pairs given values.
Based on the pairs that are generated from step 5 to 16; $(x,y)$ = $14 \text{, \, 25}$; there are a total of $\boxed{26}$ pairs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$
Generated completion: Step 1: To find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$ with $y < x \le 100$ such that $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ are integers, we can represent these values of x and y.
Step 2: $\frac xy$ can be represented with the prime factorization of x and y. Let's consider the given number to be represented as 2\sqrt xy + a, where a is some integer.
Step 3: When a = 1, and y < x, this has 99 possible combinations.
Step 4: For a = 2, x = 1 + \sqrt{4} and y = \frac{4}{4 + r} = \sqrt{4r} where 0 < r < 100. Since y must be a whole number for x to be a positive integer, we have 99 - r + 1, we can consider r from 1 to 98.
Step 5: In the equation (1 + r)\sqrt 4r = 99 - r + 1 we have r from 1 to 98, we have 98( 98 + 1). (It contains 98 numbers  1 to 98, hence 98( 97).
Step 6: Also let a = 3 to 98 and apply the same logic as before which we get a = 98 + \sqrt{4a} so the equation 98 + \sqrt4a = 99 + r\sqrt 4r contains 98 - r +1 numbers and this has 99 - (98) numbers
Step 7: Applying these two cases, we can calculate the number of possible solutions for both values of a by adding these results together.

### Step 1: For the first case we have a = 1, which gives 99 + 98 or 197.
Step 2: For the second case we have a = 2, which gives 99 - 98 = 1.
Step 3: For the third case, which a = 3. This gives 99 - 97 = 2.
Step 4: Therefore the value for a = 1 gives 197 solutions.
Step 5: Adding these results from each case gives 198 solutions.

The final answer is $\boxed{198}$.
Generated completion: ## Step 1: To solve the problem, let's consider the conditions given.
We need to find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ where $y < x \leq 100$ and both $\frac{x}{y}$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ are integers.

## Step 2: Express the conditions for $\frac{x}{y}$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be integers.
For $\frac{x}{y}$ to be an integer, $x$ must be divisible by $y$, which means $x = ky$ for some positive integer $k$. Substituting $x = ky$ into $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$, we get $\frac{(ky+1)}{y+1}$.

## Step 3: Analyze the second condition to determine the possible values of $x$ for each value of $y$.
For $\frac{(ky+1)}{y+1}$ to be an integer, $(ky+1)$ must be divisible by $y+1$. It can be inferred that $ky+1$ is divisible by $y+1$ when $k$ is either $1$ or when $k$ is a multiple of $\frac{y+1}{y}$.

## Step 4: Evaluate the implications of $k = 1$.
When $k = 1$, $x = y$. So, we are looking for ordered pairs of positive integers $(y, y)$ where $y < 100$.

## Step 5: Determine the possible values of $y$ where $x = y$.
For each possible value of $y$ from $1$ to $99$, $y$ can be paired with itself resulting in ordered pairs $(y, y)$. There are $99$ possible ordered pairs.

## Step 6: Evaluate the implications of $k$ being a multiple of $\frac{y+1}{y}$, for $k \neq 1$.
When $k = \frac{y+1}{y}$, it can be rewritten as $y+1 = ky$. This implies $k = \frac{y(y+1)}{y}$. For the fraction $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be an integer, we substitute $x = ky$ and get $\frac{ky+1}{y+1}$, which must also be an integer.

## Step 7: Use a different approach considering $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is always an integer if $(y+1)$ is a factor of $x+1$.
We use the Euclid-Euler Phi theorem for a related solution. By exploring the numbers $\{n + 1\}$ the Euclid-Euler phi function $\phi(n) = \phi(4\phi(2^{p})-2^{p-1}[(p-1)p] - 1\cdot p + 4$ provides insight into the relationship between 4 $\phi(n)p + [-(-1)^p]$ where p is a prime and $\phi(2^{p})$ the Euler phi function where p is odd.

## Step 8: Implementing the solution for the problem.
Applying Euler's Phi Theorem, the solutions for k = 4m+1 where, the numbers $\{n+1\}$ must be $4\phi(2^{k}) = 3\cdot 6 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 = 60$, where p = 2.
Further simplification reduces to solving for k: $3(4 \phi(2^{k})=60$, $60(2^{3} -4\cdot2 )$, we get $60k(2-2^{3})=4800$ 60 = \(2^{6}k.5-80=0$. We use modular arithmetic now, solving for the modular value of $k$ we get, we can simplify, $60k\equiv -80 \pmod{ 480}$ $k\equiv -4 \pmod{10}$
k can be either $k\equiv 6 \pmod{10}$ or $k=6n+1$, $5 < x$
We also must ensure $x \ge  y + 1$ and
For $\frac{x}{y}$ to be an integer, $x$ must be divisible by $y$


## Step 9: Enumerate solutions. For possible values of $k$ $k$ can only be 6. All values corresponding with their respective pairs.
We now need to go through all  $y$ from $1$ to $99$ and find out which values yield both  x and y. Since  y < $x \leq 100$, we can solve the system for each  $y$, if  $y = 1, $ no valid values
For any value of $y $,  it is possible for $ y$ to be such that
$x \leq 99$.

For our equation  $x=yy(k+1) $ we can see that
only one possible valid value satisfies both $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{x +1}{y+1}$ since $ k+1 =0$. By substituting $ 3.3  x.5 -80 \  \left(   \begin{aligned}
We can only have  x = 20 for the condition $ \frac{x+1}{y+1}$.



## Step 10: Counting the number of $y$'s that satisfy the condition, we only have 1 value which is x = 20 for the given solution  and can be made valid by choosing any positive $ y
Therefore the valid $(x,y)$ for this case would be $ (20,100)$ resulting, from the possible range the number of (20,100) is equal to one.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1:  Let's first understand the conditions for both expressions $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be integers.
## Step 2:  We are looking for ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ where $y<x\le 100,$ and both $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ are integers.
## Step 3:  To make $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ an integer, we note that $(y+1)$ must divide $(x+1).$ This can only happen if $(y+1)$ is a divisor of $x+1.$
## Step 4:  This means that the possible values for $y+1$ can be factors of $x+1.$ This includes cases where $y+1=1, 2, 3, \ldots, 101.$
## Step 5:  For $\frac xy$ to be an integer, we also require that $x$ must be a multiple of $y.$
## Step 6:  This can happen if $x$ is either a multiple of a given factor, or it can be the only multiple of that factor. If it's a multiple of more than one factor, it would mean $(y+1)$ has more than one factor, and thus would not divide $(x+1).$
## Step 7:  We're essentially looking for pairs where $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime. So, we remove the cases where $x$ and $y+1$ share a common factor from our count.
## Step 8:  To do this, we need to find the number of possible values for $x.$
## Step 9:  The numbers that work are the multiples of the divisors of 101, which are from 1 to $\lfloor \frac{100}{\sqrt{101}} \rfloor.\log_{101} \approx 15.98$ to 16. This gives us our value for $k$ that corresponds to the number of possible $x$ values.
## Step 10:  The number of possible $x$ values that meet the criteria are all the numbers from 17 to 316 (of the form $101k+1$), i.e., $1, 2, \ldots, 315.$
## Step 11:  To find the number of positive integers $(x,y)$, we calculate $\frac{316 + 17 - 1}{2} =190$. We divide 316 by 2 since $y<y+1.$

The final answer is: $\boxed{190}$
Generated completion: <think> First, we need to find an expression for $x+y.$ We can express $\frac{x+y}{xy}$ as $\frac{x+1}{xy}$ $\frac{x+y+1}{xy}.$ This is equivalent to $\frac{\frac 1x +1}{\frac xy},$ which is an integer by the Euclidean Criterion of Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality. We have \begin{align*} \frac\frac1x+\frac12 &\geq 1 \\ \frac xy+\frac22 &\geq 1 \\ xy+2 &\geq xy \\ 2 &\geq 0.\end{align*}Thus, we can conclude that $x  0,$ so we need only consider the fraction $\frac{x+y}{xy}=\frac{x+1}{xy}$ to be an integer when $-100 \le x \le 100$. We can assume no negative fractions since both $x$and $y$ are positive integers. Therefore, $y(xy)\ge xy \Rightarrow y\ge 1.$We have $\frac{x+1}{y+1}=m =\frac{1}{y},$ which we are also assuming to be an integer since both $x$and $y$ are positive integers. Thus, the fraction is greater than 0. We can conclude that $y+1>z>0,$ $z \ge 2.$ Therefore, the fraction will be greater than $2.$ On the other hand, $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ will be less than 4 when $y = 100$, so to achieve this value our ordered pairs can be listed as \left\{{1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10,11,12,13\}$. Therefore, the number of possible pairs are 12. The number of ordered pairs is given by $\left ( \begin{smallarray}{cc} 100 \\ 1 \end{smallarray} \right )$ = 100.

Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the base cases for the recursive sequence
To find $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, we first need to understand the recursive definition of the sequence. We are given that $a_{0} = 2$, $a_{1} = 5$, and $a_{2} = 8$. For $n > 2$, the sequence is defined as the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by 11.

## Step 2: Calculate the next terms of the sequence using the recursive definition
Using the definition of the sequence, we can calculate the next terms as follows:
- $a_{3} = 4(a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0}) = 4(8 + 5 + 2) = 4(15) = 60 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{4} = 4(a_{3} + a_{2} + a_{1}) \equiv 4(5 + 8 + 5) \equiv 4(18) \equiv 72 \equiv 6 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{5} = 4(a_{4} + a_{3} + a_{2}) \equiv 4(6 + 5 + 8) \equiv 4(19) \equiv 76 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{6} = 4(a_{5} + a_{4} + a_{3}) \equiv 4(10 + 6 + 5) \equiv 4(21) \equiv 84 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{7} = 4(a_{6} + a_{5} + a_{4}) \equiv 4(2 + 10 + 6) \equiv 4 \times 18 \equiv 72 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{8} = 4(a_{7} + a_{6} + a_{5}) \equiv 4(4 + 2 + 10) \equiv 4 \times 16 \equiv 64 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{9} = 4(a_{8} + a_{7} + a_{6}) \equiv 4(9 + 4 + 2) \equiv 4 \times 15 \equiv 60 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{10} = 4(a_{9} + a_{8} + a_{7}) \equiv 4(8 + 9 + 4) \equiv 4 \times 21 \equiv 84 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{11} = 4(a_{10} + a_{9} + a_{8}) \equiv 4(7 + 8 + 9) \equiv 4 \times 24 \equiv 96 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{12} = 4(a_{11} + a_{10} + a_{9}) \equiv 4(3 + 7 + 8) \equiv 4 \times 18 \equiv 72 \equiv 6 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{13} = 4(a_{12} + a_{11} + a_{10}) \equiv 4(6 + 3 + 7) \equiv 4 \times 16 \equiv 64 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{14} = 4(a_{13} + a_{12} + a_{11}) \equiv 4(2 + 6 + 3) \equiv 4 \times 11 \equiv 44 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{15} = 4(a_{14} + a_{13} + a_{12}) \equiv 4(0 + 2 + 6) \equiv 4 \times 8 \equiv 32 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{16} = 4(a_{15} + a_{14} + a_{13}) \equiv 4(10 + 0 + 2) \equiv 4 \times 12 \equiv 48 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{17} = 4(a_{16} + a_{15} + a_{14}) \equiv 4(7 + 10 + 0) \equiv 4 \times 17 \equiv 68 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{18} = 4(a_{17} + a_{16} + a_{15}) \equiv 4(2 + 7 + 10) \equiv 4 \times 19 \equiv 76 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{19} = 4(a_{18} + a_{17} + a_{16}) \equiv 4(3 + 2 + 7) \equiv 4 \times 12 \equiv 48 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{20} = 4(a_{19} + a_{18} + a_{17}) \equiv 4(4 + 3 + 2) \equiv 4 \times 9 \equiv 36 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{21} = 4(a_{20} + a_{19} + a_{18}) \equiv 4(3 + 4 + 3) \equiv 4 \times 10 \equiv 40 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$
- $a_{22} = 4(a_{21} + a_{20} + a_{19}) \equiv 4(9 + 3 + 4) \equiv 4 \times 16 \equiv 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$
Then the sequence repeats.

## Step 3: Identify the periodicity of the sequence modulo 11 and use it to find $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$
From the calculations above, it is evident that the sequence $a_n \pmod{11}$ has period 10. Since $2018 = 201 \times 10 + 8$, according to the periodicity of the sequence, $a_{2018} \equiv a_8 \pmod{11}$, and $a_{2020} \equiv a_{20} \pmod{11}$, and $a_{2022} \equiv a_{2020} \pmod{11}$.
Thus, we can compute $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$ using their base cases and this periodicity.
$a_{2018} \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
$a_{2020} \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
$a_{2022} \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$

## Step 4: Calculate the product $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$
Now that we have $a_{2018} \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$, $a_{2020} \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$, and $a_{2022} \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$, we can calculate the product of these terms using the properties of modular arithmetic.
A product of congruences can be simplified using the property:
$a_{m} \cdot a_{n} \equiv a_{n}^2 \pmod{c}$

## Step 5: Reduce each term using the properties of modular arithmetic
Considering that $a
Generated completion: <think> Since for the problem, we need to find $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, let's start by examining what we know about the previous terms $a_n$:
- For $n=0$, $a_{n} = a  {0} = 2$.
- For $n = 1$, $a_{1} = 5$.
- For $n = 2$, $a_{2} = 8$
With the recursive formula, calculate two more terms using $4(a_{1} + a_{0} + a_{-1})$, we have $4(5 + 2 + a_{-1}) = 18$ remainder 6, then we use this result $4(a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0}) = 72$ remainder 0, and finally $4(a_1 + a_0 + a_{-2}) = 120$ remainder 11. Thus, we can see that $a_3 = 3, a_4 = 6, a_5 = 10, a_6 = 2, a_7  = 7, a_8 = 0$, and the sequence is periodic with period 6 and the period length is 6. To find $a_{2018}$ and $a_{2020}$, we see that both  $a_2$ and $a_4$ are $a_2, a_{n  \,ext{mod 6}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Identify the recursive formula and initial conditions given for the sequence $a_n$.
The sequence is defined recursively as $a_n$ being the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by $11$. We are given that $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 5$, and $a_2 = 8$. We need to calculate the product $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$.

## Step 2: Determine a pattern for the first few terms of the sequence to understand the trend and periodicity of the sequence.
Let's calculate the next few terms to observe if there's any pattern or periodicity.

## Step 3: Calculate the next terms.
Given the recursive formula:
- For $n = 3$: $a_3 = 4(a_2 + a_1 + a_0) \mod 11 = 4(8 + 5 + 2) \mod 11 = (4 \cdot 15) \mod 11 = 60 \mod 11 = 5$
- For $n = 4$: $a_4 = 4(a_3 + a_2 + a_1) \mod 11 = 4(5 + 8 + 5) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 18 \mod 11 = 72 \mod 11 = 6$
- For $n = 5$: $a_5 = 4(a_4 + a_3 + a_2) \mod 11 = 4(6 + 5 + 8) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 19 \mod 11 = 76 \mod 11 = 10$
- For $n = 6$: $a_6 = 4(a_5 + a_4 + a_3) \mod 11 = 4(10 + 6 + 5) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 21 \mod 11 = 84 \mod 11 = 7$
- For $n = 7$: $a_7 = 4(a_6 + a_5 + a_4) \mod 11 = 4(7 + 10 + 6) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 23 \mod 11 = 92 \mod 11 = 6$
- For $n = 8$: $a_8 = 4(a_7 + a_6 + a_5) \mod 11 = 4(6 + 7 + 10) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 23 \mod 11 = 92 \mod 11 = 6$

## Step 4: Determine the pattern and periodicity of the sequence $a_n$.
We observe from the calculated terms that the sequence starts repeating after the 8th term because the remainders start repeating themselves with the same pattern once they surpass 11: $6 \mod 11, 7 \mod 11, 10 \mod 11, 6 \mod 11$. This pattern will be consistent thereafter because:
- The pattern has now fully repeated for $a_8$, which means if the pattern resumes with the same numbers, and $n > 8$, the remainder of $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ when divided by 11 will always equal $4$, with $a_n = 6$.

## Step 5: Calculate $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$ based on the pattern's periodicity.
## Step 6: Considering that the sequence becomes $6, 7, 10, 6$ after the initial terms and the repeating pattern of $6$ after the first 8 terms in the sequence, any other terms can be described as $6$. This simplifies the calculation.

Given the pattern:
- $a_{2018} = 6$
- $a_{2020} = 6$
- $a_{2022} = 6$

## Step 7: Calculate the product $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$
$a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022} = 6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 216$

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1
Recognize that we need to find a pattern in the sequence $a_n$, starting with the initial values $a_{0} = 2$, $a_{1} = 5$, and $a_{2} = 8$ to solve the recursive relation.

## Step 2
To find the next term in the sequence, we first calculate $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$, which can be found using the given recursive relation by substituting the values of $a_{0}$, $a_{1}$, and $a_{2}$. We get that $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ equals $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$, then we replace the values in the equation with $4$, $a_{0}$, $a_{1}$ to solve for new terms.

## Step 3
The process is repeated several times until we get into a repeating sequence and find a pattern for the $a_n$ sequence.

## Step 4
$a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ = $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ = 4 * (8 + 5 + 2).

## Step 5
Performing the arithmetic operation in the equation, we get: $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ = $4 * 15$.

## Step 6
Now we divide $4 * 15$ to get $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ = 60.

## Step 7
Now that we have obtained a value for $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ = 60, we now find $a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ by using the same process.

## Step 8
Next $a_{n-2}$ + $a_{n-3}$ = $4(a_{n-2}$ + $a_{n-3} + a_{n-4}$). Replacing the values $a_{n-3}$ and $a_{n-4}$ we will get: $(a_{n-2}$ + $a_{n-3} $ = 240, a_{n-2}$ + $a_{n-3} = 240$

## Step 9
Using the equation obtained for $a_{n-2}$ + $a_{n-3}$, we substitute it in equation  $(a_{n-2}$ + $a_{n-3} + a_{n-4}$).
Using equation we get a_{n-1}$ + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ + a_{n-4} = 540. Since the value of a_{n-4} equals 2 a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2}, we get
4(a_{n-1}$ + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ + a_{n-4}$) = 540.

## Step 10
Using the equation obtained for a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}, we substituted it in 4 * (a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-4}$).

## Step 11
Solving the new equation $4 * a_{n-1}$ + 4 * $a_{n-2} + 4 * a_{n-3}$ = 540.

## Step 12
We get $4($ a_{n-1}$ + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$) = 540, which simplifies to $a_{n-1}$ + a_{n-2}$ + a_{n-3}$ = 135.

## Step  13
To avoid going into too many iterations and reduce repetition, note that the value of $a_{n}$
$ a_n$  $=$ 4 * 135 + $10 * (n-2)$.

## Step 14
Calculating for an for values between $ n = 2018$, $2 * a_{2018}$ +  $(2018 * 10)$  = $ 66960 + 20180$ to get  a_{2018} which is $= 87140$.

## Step 15
Now calculate $a_{2020}$.
## Step  16
$a_{2019}$ + $ a_{2018}$ $+$ $a_{2017}$ =  $4$, $a_{2019}$  = $( a_{2018}$ -  135)/4 $(a_{2018}$
Since $a_{n}$ is a remainder when 4(a_{n-1};
## Step 17
This leaves  a_{2018}$ $= a_{2019}$ and for  a_{2018} +  a_{2017} = a_{2019}$  $(5* (a_{2019}$.

## Step 18
Substituting $(a_{2019}$  $=  a_{  2018}$ ) in the equation$ a_{2018}$ +  a_{2017}$.
This shows that if $a_{2018}$ = $ a_{  2017}$ then $a_{2017}$ =
Since $a_{2018}$ +  a_{2017}$ = a_{2019} $ =  a_{2018}$ then $ a_{2018}$ must also = $ a_{2019}$, which is a contradiction.
So a_{2018}$ =  a_{2017} =  a_{2016}$ = $ a_{2015}$ = $ a_{2014}$.

## Step 19
We  continue  2017 times.
## Step 20
Using $a_n = 4*a_{n-1} + 10*(n-2)$ we substitute in $a_{2016}$, $(a_{2017}$ = $4 * a_{2016}$ + $10 * (2015)$, which is $4 * ( 6912) + 20150$.
$ a_{2017}$  = 27456 + (20150), $ = 47606. Then a_{2016}$  =  a_{2015}$ = $47606$.

## Step 21
Now continue for another 20 iterations
## Step  22
$a_{2017}$ + $a_{2016}$ $+$ $a_{2015}$  = $(4a_{2016}$ + $10{(2015)} + a_{2015}$.
## Step  23
$ a_{2017}$ +  $ a_{2016}$ $+$ $ a_{2015}$ = $4 * 47606 + 10 * (2015)$.

## Step 24
$ a_{2017}$ + $ a_{2016}$ $+$ $ a_{2015}$ =  $188248 + 20150$, $= 269598$.

## Step 25
Since $a_{2017}$ + $ a_{2016}$ $+$ $ a_{2015}$$= 269598$,
We now substitute $ a_{2015}$ in  $a_{2018}$ =  $67644$.

## Step 26
We calculate a_{2018}$.

## Step 27
a_{2018}$ = ( $67644$ + $a_{2017}$)$ $+$ $a_{2016}$$. Since we have already $ a_{2017} =  $27456$, we plug it into the equation and get
## Step 28
a_{2018}$ =   ( $67644$ + $274
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Initialize the problem by establishing the given recursive equation for the sequence $a_n$.
Given the recursive equation $a_{n} = 4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}) \mod 11$, with initial values $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 5$, and $a_2 = 8$, we need to calculate $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$.

## Step 2: Calculate the next values of the sequence to identify any patterns or cycles within the sequence.
Using the recursive equation, we can calculate subsequent values of $a_n$. First, let's calculate $a_3$.

## Step 3: Apply the recursive equation for $n=3$.
$a_3 = 4(a_2 + a_1 + a_0) \mod 11 = 4(8 + 5 + 2) \mod 11 = 4(15) \mod 11 = 60 \mod 11 = 5$

## Step 4: Continue calculating subsequent values of the sequence until a pattern or cycle becomes evident.
We continue the same process for $n=4$ and $n=5$.

## Step 5: Apply the recursive equation for $n=4$ to obtain $a_4$.
$a_4 = 4(a_3 + a_2 + a_1) \mod 11 = 4(5 + 8 + 5) \mod 11 = 4(18) \mod 11 = 72 \mod 11 = 6$

## Step 6: Apply the recursive equation for $n=5$ to obtain $a_5$.
$a_5 = 4(a_4 + a_3 + a_2) \mod 11 = 4(6 + 5 + 8) \mod 11 = 4(19) \mod 11 = 76 \mod 11 = 10$

## Step 7: Continue the process for $n=6$ to look for a pattern or cycle.
$a_6 = 4(a_5 + a_4 + a_3) \mod 11 = 4(10 + 6 + 5) \mod 11 = 4(21) \mod 11 = 84 \mod 11 = 7$

## Step 8: Continue calculating subsequent values of the sequence to confirm the pattern or cycle is found within a pattern or cycle.
Continuing the same process for $n=7$.

## Step 9: Apply the recursive equation for $n=7$ to obtain $a_7$.
Since we've calculated $a_7$ in step 8, we will directly proceed to calculate $a_8$ for finding $a_{2020}$, $a_{2018}$, and $a_{2022}$ without specifying $a_{2020}$ and $a_{2022}$.
## Step 10: Recognize that without explicit calculations for $a_{2018}$ and $a_{2022}$ in the sequence, we need to analyze the structure of the numbers to identify the cycle.
From the initial calculations of these steps, we see the nature of the sequence doesn't immediately lend itself to a straightforward arithmetic or geometric sequence due to its dependence on the recursive formula, indicating a potential cycle in the sequence due to the properties of modular arithmetic with a constant difference (i.e., modulo 11 changes every 6 steps as observed in steps 2 through 10).

## Step 11: Observe and confirm the pattern or cycle in the sequence given.
Since we deduced in Step 10, we hypothesize or calculate that a cycle is likely in patterns of length 6 within the sequence modulo 11.

## Step 12: Since the pattern will repeat every 6 steps and we need values for $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$, use the cycle length to reduce the problem into calculating or predicting these values modulo 11.
Since the pattern repeats every 6 steps, we use this knowledge to simplify the calculation of large $n$. Calculate $a_6$ to identify a periodicity that will help in evaluating $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$ modulo 11.

## Step 13: Given the periodicity of the sequence we'll determine $a_{6}$ as part of a cycle.
The pattern seems consistent; then since we observe that there's no explicit calculation of $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$ directly in the pattern that will emerge after establishing a clear pattern cycle like the previous, we now must use properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that every 6 step cycle gives $a_{6}$, an exact position in pattern as part of cycle. We can start thinking of utilizing the properties of residues in modular addition, particularly since the calculations were $a_n = 4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}) \mod 11$.

## Step 14: Reduce the problem to calculating directly, considering possible properties or cycle pattern for simplification to compute the actual values of $a_{2022}$, $a_{2018}$ before, and $a_{2020}$ by understanding their modular equivalent when simplifying by modular arithmetic.
To simplify the process, utilize properties of sequence given by defining the formula so that modulo 11 is considered as $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$. For calculating large $a_n$ in a particular cycle, and specifically for $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$, first finding a direct relationship that helps their computations.

## Step 15: Realize that $n=6n + 3$ yields to the $a_n = 4a_{n+3}$ pattern, utilizing the established recursive equation for $n$. Knowing the actual sequence repeats after every 6 values, identify this to find desired $a_n$.
The specific value of $n + 3$ to look for a corresponding sequence value matches with the specific values 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 (or cycle) given $n$ values.

## Step 16: Find the values of $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$ based on the given $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and the determined relationship $a_n = 4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$.
Given the periodicity and modular properties of the sequence we've considered the computation to follow our pattern using our recursive relationship: To determine $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$ directly, it simplifies greatly as follows:

$a_{2022}$ corresponds to 2 in this cycle ($2018 \equiv 2$, 2019 is $2019 \equiv 4$), $a_{2018} \equiv 5$, $a_{2020}$ is 5.

## Step 17: Simplify the equation using the determined values $a_{2018} \equiv 5$, $a_{2019}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022} = a_{2}$ in the sequence to compute the final result.


$5 \cdot 4 \cdot a_{2}$


## Step 18: Calculate the final value by multiplying the values together.
Since $a_{2} = 8$


$5 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 160$.



The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the recursive function to calculate $a_n$.
$a_n$ is defined recursively as the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by $11$.

## Step 2: Compute the initial terms of the sequence.
$a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 5$, $a_2 = 8$.

## Step 3: Apply the recursive definition to calculate subsequent terms.
We need to calculate $a_3$ to $a_{2022}$ and their product to find $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$.

## Step 4: Calculate $a_3$.
We first compute $a_3$ using the recursive definition:
$a_3 = 4(a_2 + a_1 + a_0) \mod 11 = 4(8+5+2) \mod 11 = 4(15) \mod 11 = 60 \mod 11 = 5$.

## Step 5: Calculate $a_4$.
Using the recursive definition:
$a_4 = 4(a_3 + a_2 + a_1) \mod 11 = 4(5+8+5) \mod 11 = 4(18) \mod 11 = 72 \mod 11 = 6$.

## Step 6: Calculate $a_5$.
Using the recursive definition:
$a_5 = 4(a_4 + a_3 + a_2) \mod 11 = 4(6+5+8) \mod 11 = 4(19) \mod 11 = 76 \mod 11 = 10$.

## Step 7: Continue calculating subsequent terms until finding a pattern or until we reach the goal.
We continue this process for subsequent terms: $a_6$, $a_7$, $a_8$, and so on. We will look for a pattern in the sequence.

## Step 8: Determine the pattern in the sequence.
For the purposes of finding $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, we need to find the value of $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$. Given the nature of the calculation, it might be beneficial to look for a periodic pattern in the sequence.

## Step 9: Apply the recursive formula to compute additional terms.
Let $b_n = a_n + b_{n-1} + b_{n-2} + b_{n-3}$, where $b_{n-3} = a_0$, $b_{n-2} = a_1$ and $b_0 = a_2$ for $n > 3$. Now, calculate $b_n$ to find periodicity, which can help simplify the calculation for easier computation.

## Step 10: Perform further calculations for $a_n$ using the recursive formula for $b_n$ to find periodicity.
Since we observe the first few terms of the sequence after step 4 are: 60, 6, 10, 5, 6, 10, 5, 6. It's apparent the sequence has a periodic pattern with a period of length 4, with 5, 6, 10, 5.

## Step 11: Apply the periodic pattern to compute $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$.
Given the sequence's periodicity is 4, $(2018+1=2019) = 2019 \mod 4 = 1$, $(2020+2=2022) = 2022 \mod 4 = 2$, and thus, $a_{2018} = a_1$, $a_{2020} = a_2$, $a_{2022} = a_0$. But, according to the problem, we need the product of three terms $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022} = (a_1)a_2a_0$. As $a_0 = 2$, then $(a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}) = (a_1)a_2a_0 = (5)(8)(2) = 80$.

## Step 12: Since we found that the product of $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$ is 80 and the periodicity of the sequence, there is no need for further computation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$

Substituting gives $a_{6}\equiv 4(6 + 6 + 8) \mod 11 \iff a_{6}\equiv 4(20) \mod 11 \iff a_{6}\equiv 88 \mod 11$ <think>, since $88\equiv 6\mod 11$. Since $a_{6} \equiv a_{5} \mod 11$ (since 88 is congruent to 6 mod 11, for $a_3,a_4,a_5$) we can now simplify the above expression $a_6 \equiv a_5 \mod 11$, we can find $a_{7}$ by again substituting the values of $a_4$ and $a_5$. Again simplifying the above expression we have: $a_{7} \equiv 4(a_{6}+a_5+a_4)\mod{11} \equiv 4(6+5+6)\mod{11} \equiv 4(17)\mod{11} \iff a_{7} \equiv 68\mod{11} \iff a_7\equiv 6\mod{11}.$ <answer> and we can continue this way to see how $a_{n}$ relates to $a_{n-3}$. Since the relation is linear we can find $a_{10}$, $a_{11}$, and so on, by substituting to get $a_{10} \equiv 6\mod{11}$ and $a_{11} \equiv 6\mod{11}.$ We can continue this way further to see how the value of the sequence changes. <think> To find the final answer we can look at the pattern in the values of $a_n$ we can see how the value of $a_n$ increases when $n$ increases by $4$, until we reach a pattern that continues.  Let's examine  a few more terms to look for a pattern.  <think> a_{3}\equiv 4\mod{11}, a_{4}\equiv 6\mod {11}, and a_{5}\equiv 6\mod {11}.  If the pattern continues as we see  a_{3}\equiv 4\mod {11}, a_{4}\equiv 6\mod {11},a_{5}\equiv 6\mod {11} then  a_{6}\equiv 6\mod {11}   and to find $a_{10}$, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$ we would need to continue the pattern, so we do: $a_{7}\equiv 6\mod 11$, $a_{8}\equiv 6\mod 11$, $a_{9}\equiv 6\mod 11$, $a_{10}\equiv 6\mod 11$, $a_{11}\equiv 6\mod 11$. Since $a_{10} \equiv a_9 \equiv a_8 \equiv a_7 \equiv a_6 \equiv \frac{6}{11}\mod{11}$ we notice the last two terms will continue to be equal since they are equal to each other.


Since  $a_{7}=a_{6}=a_{5}=a_{4}=a_{3}=6$, then we can write $a_{7}=a_{6}=a_{5}=a_{4}=\boxed{\frac{6}{11}}$
Substituting the initial values into the recurrence relation $a_{3} = 4(a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0}),mod 11$
We get the same as $a_{3} \equiv 4(8 + 5 + 2) mod 11$ or $a_{3} \equiv 4(-1) mod 11,\iff a_{3} \equiv 4 mod 11 $.
We have $a_{7} \equiv 6$
Now to find $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, we can use the pattern observed.  We see that the pattern is $\frac{6}{11}$.  Since the pattern $6, 6, 6,\dots$ we can continue for $a_{2018}$ and use the fact that $a_{n} \equiv \frac{6}{11}$ when $n$ is a multiple of $4$, which is true for $2018, 2014, 2012, \dots$. Similarly, when $n$ is a multiple of $4$ plus something greater than zero we can use it to find $\frac{6}{11}$ and find the product. We now find $2018, 2020, 2022, \bar{2024 }, 2028, 2032,$ $2036,$ etc. We then notice that each of these are multiples of $4$ so they can all be expressed as $\frac{6}{11}$. Since all the values for $n$ in question are multiples of $4$, we can express $2018, 2020, 2022, 2024, 2028, 2032$ as $\frac{6}{11}, \frac{6}{11}, \frac{6}{11}, \frac{6}{11}, \frac{6}{11}, \frac{6}{11}$ and multiply the terms.

\frac{\log{x}}{\ln{225}}\cdot\ln{y} + \frac{\log{y}}{\ln{64}}\cdot \ln{x} = 4\cdot\ln{x} \ln{y}$
We notice that $\frac{1$ is missing in the numerator. We can substitute 225 as $15^2$ and 64 as $4^3$ and we get:

\frac{2\log{x}}{\ln{15}\ln{y}}\cdot\ln{y} + \frac{\log{y}}{\ln{4}\ln{x}}\cdot\ln{x} = 4\ln{x} \ln{y}.$

Simplifying the expression further, we have

The equation becomes $\frac{2\log{x}}{\ln{15}\ln{y}} + \frac{\ln{y}}{\ln{16}\ln{x}} = 4\ln{x} \ln{y}.$

This gives us \begin{align*} \log_2{64} \log_{15}{225}&=\log_2{2^6} \log_{15}{15^2}\\ \log_2{64}\log_{15}{225}&=\log_{2}{2^6} \log_{15}{15^2}\\ \frac{\log_{2}{64}}{\log_{2}{15}} \log_{15}{15^2}&=\frac{6}{2} \log_{15}{15^2}\\ \log_{2}{64}\log_{{15}{.15}}^2}&=3 \log_{15}{15}\\ \boxed{\log_{2}{64}=3 \log_{15}{15}} \end{align*}. We can simplify this using the definition of log $10$, for $x=\log_{10}{a}=y$, we can write $10^y=a $. But this simplifies to $4y=y\frac2{3}$, simplifying then gives $2=3\frac12$, simplifying again to get $2=\boxed{3}$  \end{align*}

Therefore, $x \cdot y \cdot x \cdot y=15\cdot 3=\boxed{45}.$

Generated completion: <think> First, we know that $\log_{225}{x}+\log_{64}{y} = 4$ and $\log_{x}{225}-\log_{y}{64} = 1$ are both logarithmic equations. We can simplify these equations to
<think> We can use the change of base formula: $\log_{225}{x}+\log_{64}{y} = 4\log_{64}{225}$ implies $\log_{64}{y}+\log_{x}{225}= 4\log_{225/64}{x}$ and $\log_{x}{225}-\log_{y}{64}= 1$ implies $\log_{y}{225}/\log_{x}{64} = 1$ </think>
and thus
\begin{align*} \log_{16}{225} + \log_{x}{225} = 4\log_{16}{225} \\ \log_{16}{64} - \log_{y}{64} = 1 \\ \log_{x}{45} & = 4 \log_{16} {64} \\ \log_{x}{45} & = 4(2) \\ \log_{x}{225} & = 2\ log_{16} {225} \\ \log_{x}{(x\cdot225)} & = \log_{16}{(x\cdot225)} \end{align*}
This implies $x^{2}=16^{2}$ which implies $x = 16\implies x = \boxed{\pm 16}$, and since we know $\log_{x}{45}$ is the logarithm of the constant when base $x$ is 16, $\log_{x}{16} = \log_{16}{45}$. Thus, $4\log_{16}{64} - \log_{y}{64} = 1$ is equivalent to $\log_{16}{64}-\log_{y}{64}=1$
Therefore, $4\log_{16}{64}-\log_{y}{64}=1$, which can be rearranged as
\begin{align*} \log_{16}{64}-\log_{y}{64}-4\log_{16}{64} \log_{16}{4} = 0  \end{align*}
This can also be written as $\log_{16}{64}-5\log_{16}{64}=0$
If $k= \log_{16}{64}$.
Solving the two equations $\log_{16}{64}-5\log_{16}k=0$ and $\log_{16}{k} =k \implies k^{k}= 64$
This implies $k = \log_{16}{64} = \log_{16}{16^{2}}$ and $k^{k} = 64
Since <think> the two logarithmic equations are the same as $\log_{16}{64}=\log_{16}{16^{2}}= 2$
\end{think}
Therefore,
\begin{align*} x\cdot 16\cdot 225=\left( \pm16\right)\left(\pm16\right)^{2} \end{align*}
If we assume there are positive solutions $(x,y)$, then $x = 16y$. Also, if we assume there are negative solutions $(x,y)$, then $y = -16x$
Therefore, the solution of $x \cdot 16 \cdot 225 = \left( \pm 16 \right)\left( \pm 16 \right)^{2}$ is $\left( x, y\right) = \left( 225, -225\right)$
Thus, $$\log_{30}{x_1y_1 x_2 y_2} = \log_{30}\left(225(-225)\right) = \log_{30}\left(-5000\right)$$
