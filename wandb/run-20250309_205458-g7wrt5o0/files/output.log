Generated completion: <think> To solve this problem, we first need to find the area of the triangle PQR. We know that $\angle Q = 60^{\circ}$ and the side lengths of the hexagon are 1. By considering similar triangles $\triangle PRS and \triangle ABC$, we find that $PR = AP=a$ and $RS=b$. We also know that we can obtain the lengths of CR and QS using the pentagon's properties and the area will involve some 30-60-90 triangle ratios.

Generated completion: <think> To start with, we notice that by the Ptolemy's Theorem, we know that
$(AP + 1)(BQ) = (PQ)(AR),$
and similarly $(BP + 1)(CR) = (PR)(AQ)$.
Therefore, adding these two equations together gives us that
$$(AP + 1 + BP + 1)(QR - AB) = 2(PQ)(AR)\implies (a + b + 2) QR - AB + 1 = 2(PQ)(AR).$$
To further analyze this expression, we can rewrite it as $(2(AQ + AR - AB) + RQ) = (a + b + 2) QR$. We notice that we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation further by rewriting $(AQ + AR - AB) = \tan 75^\circ,$ as $AQ + AR - AB = \tan 75^\circ = 2 - \sin^2 (45^\circ).$
We can use the fact that $2 - \sin^2 \theta = \cos 2 \theta = \frac{1-\cos (2\theta)}{2},$ where $\theta$ is an angle with a cosine of $\theta$.
Therefore, we can express $\cos 75^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 150^\circ}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2},$ from which we then compute $\sin 75^{\circ} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4},$ giving $AQ = AR + AB$ and $QR = AR + AB + 1.$
Plugging this into the equation $(a + b + 2) QR - AB + 1 = 2(a + b + 2) AR,$ we obtain $\frac{1}{4}$ as the reduced constant term.
The final result for the area of the triangle is
$=\frac{[(a+b+2)\cdot (AR +AB)]\cdot(1 + \frac {1}{4}}{2}=\frac{(a+b+2) \sin 75^{\circ} AR + \sin 150^{\circ}(AR)}{2}.$
Since $AR=1$ and $\sin 150^{\circ} = \frac{\sqrt {3}}{4}$, we can calculate that $AR+\frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{3} (a+b+2) = QR\sin 75^{\circ} + \frac{(a + b+2) (1+\frac {1}{2}}{4}$.
Therefore, putting everything together we see that
$$\frac{(a+b+2) \sin 75^{\circ} + \frac{(a + b+2)(1+\frac{1}{2}}{4}}{2}\sin 150^{\circ}}{2}\implies \frac{(a+b+2)\cdot \frac{5+\sqrt {3} + a + b + 2}{4}}{5+\sqrt{3}}.$$
Thus the expression is in the form $\frac{a + b\sqrt{c}}{d},$ with $a=d=5 + \sqrt {3},$ $b=d=2,$ and $c=3.$ Hence the answer we
Generated completion: <think> The regular hexagon is an equilateral triangle so we can rotate it by 30 degrees clockwise. Using the law of cosines, we get PQ^2 = PA^2 + PR^2 - 2*(PA*PR)*cos(theta) = 1^2 + 2 - 2*1*2*cos(30) = 5. Thus PA = PR = sqrt(5). Therefore, the area of the triangle is the region of the sector of a circle with radius (5) divided by six (in the center of the circle) so the angle (30) is the angle of the sector and the area of the triangle is equal to pi *5^2 * 3/20 = (15*pi)/4. Therefore the answer is 59.
Generated completion: <think> We begin by forming $\triangle ABC$. We set $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=1$ since they have integer sides. As $\triangle ABC$ is a regular hexagon, it also forms a regular triangle. As the angles of $\triangle ABC$ are $\angle A = 60^{\circ}$, $\angle B = 60^{\circ}$, and $\angle C = 60^{\circ}$, we have $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral. Therefore, $AB=BC=CA=z$.
Since we know the two special $30^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}$ triangles within our $\triangle PQR$, we know that $\angle PRQ=90^{\circ}$. Now, the altitude of the triangle $\triangle ABC$ divides the triangle into two right triangles, $\widehat{ABZ}$ and $\widehat{BCZ}$. We know that $\angle A = \angle Z = 60^{\circ}$ and $\angle B = 30^{\circ}$. Then we apply the Law of Sines on the triangle $\triangle ABC$ to relate the lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$: $\frac{a}{\sin 30^{\circ}}=\frac{b}{\sin 60^{\circ}}=\frac{c}{\sin 90^{\circ}}$.
Plugging in the known side lengths for $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $\frac{1}{\sin 30^{\circ}}=\frac{1}{\sin 60^{\circ}}=\frac{1}{\cos 90^{\circ}}$. Simplifying, we find that $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$. Therefore, we know the ratio between the lengths of the two sides: $a=1$, $b=c=\sqrt{3}$. Let $z=s$. Plugging these values into the area of equilateral $\triangle ABC$, we get $\sqrt{3}^2 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$, which gives that $\sqrt{3}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and again the ratio between $a$, $b$, and $c$ can be found.
Solving for $z$, we get that $a=b=c$. Then we know that $\overline{AC}=z$. As $\overline{AD}=z$, therefore $ABCD$ is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, the value of the length of $DC$ is equal to $1$.
The area of $\triangle PQR$ is equal to $\frac{a\sqrt{3}}{4}$, given the ratio of sides of the equilateral triangle. Let's plug in the known side lengths for $a$ and $b$, we get $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$. As the value is of the form $\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, the answer is $a+b+c+d = \boxed{24}.$

We'll mark the midpoints of sides AB and CD as M and N, respectively, and the midpoint of the line passing through $\angle Q$ as H. Next, $\overrightarrow{PH}$ represents the position vector of H. Therefore, using trigonometric relations, we can find the position vector of the remaining vertex P, and then calculate the area of the triangle $\bigtriangleup PQR$ using the formula $\frac{1}{2}ab \sin C$, where a= 1. Using the area of a triangle formula, we can simplify the given expression to $(1+3\sqrt{13}) \div 6$.
Generated completion: <think> To start, we can visualize a regular hexagon $ABDEF$ inside $\bigtriangleup PQR$ so that $A$ lies on $\overline{PR$, $B$ lies on $\overline{PS$, and $D$ lies on $\overline{RQ}$.
Since the perimeter of the hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 6, the sum of the lengths of all its sides must be equal to 1.
Generated completion: <think> To find the area of $\triangle PQR$, we can start by creating an inscribed regular hexagon $NFGO$ of side length $1$ within the given $\triangle$ $ABCDEF$, such that $\overline{AD}$ is parallel to $\overline{BC}$.

From the properties of the regular hexagon, we note that $\angle FOG = 120^\circ$, $\angle FOQ = 60^\circ$, and $\angle O = 90^\circ$, so $\overline{GOF} \parallel \overline{AC}$.

With the given angles and properties of inscribed polygons, we can also find that $\overline{GH} \parallel \overline{AD}$.

Furthermore, by looking at $\triangle{OGA}, we note that it is an equilateral triangle, and thus that $\angle G = 60^\circ$. So $\angle DOG = 120^\circ$, and therefore, $DGF$ is a parallelogram, so $DG = GF = 1$.

Additionally, from the properties of $\triangle FOG$, we can find that in $\triangle {OGH}$, it must be that $GH = 1$ as well. We then also find that $\angle GOG = 30^\circ$, implying that $N = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}.$ Furthermore, then, $\triangle{NHQ} \sim GOF$ by Angle-Angle Similarity, so we also have $\angle HMQ = 30^\circ$, meaning that $QH = 30^\circ$, and we obtain that $\angle G = 30^\circ$. From this we also find $\angle QGH = 45^\circ$.

With this we know $GONF$, similar triangles $\triangle{NFG} \sim \triangle{QHN}$, which gives $HN \parallel QG$ and $FG = 2$. We thus find $HN = 2$.

Next, since $NF = 1$, then from the equation $FG = NF \sin \angle FQN$, we find that $FN = 2 \sin 30^\circ = 1$.

Finally, and finally we know the area of $\triangle{PQR} = 2.$

Generated completion: ## Step 1: Understand the condition for $\frac xy$ to be an integer.
For $\frac xy$ to be an integer, $x$ must be divisible by $y$. This implies that there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $x = ky$.

## Step 2: Understand the condition for $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be an integer.
For $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be an integer, $(x+1)$ must be divisible by $(y+1)$. This implies that there exists a positive integer $l$ such that $(x+1) = l(y+1)$.

## Step 3: Formulate a relationship between $x$ and $y$ using both conditions.
From the previous steps, we can infer that $x = ky$ and $(x+1) = l(y+1)$.

## Step 4: Express $y$ in terms of $k$ and $l$.
Substituting the value of $x$ in the expression for $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ we get, $\frac{ky+1}{y+1} = \frac{l(y+1)}{y+1}$. This can be simplified as $ky+(1) = l(y+1)$.

## Step 5: Solve for $y$ in terms of $k$.
From the equation obtained in the previous step, $ky+1 = l(y+1)$, we can isolate $y$. Rearranging the terms gives $ky-ly = 1$, which can be factored as $y(k-l) = 1$. So, $y = \frac{1}{k-l}$. To ensure that $y$ is a positive integer, $k-l$ should be a positive diviser of 1.

## Step 6: Find all possible pairs of $(k,l)$ such that $k-l$ is a positive integer and $k-l> 0$.
$(k,l)$ pairs such that $k-l > 0$ and $k-l$ is a positive integer are (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (1,-1) and (3,-2) and (7,-6). However, since $k > 100$ or $l +1 <x+1, (k,l) = (101,1), (102,2), (103,3), (104,4)$. As $y\le 100$ we only consider the pairs (101,1), (104,4) and (102,2).
Generated completion: <think> To begin, we note that $\frac xy$ must be an integer if and only if $x$  is a multiple of $y$. This leads to the conclusion from the <think> <number of multiples</number of multiples> </think> number of multiples <=100> that $$y \in \left\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100 \right\}.$$ Then for each $y$ in this set, $x$ must be one more than a multiple of $y$, i.e., $x = y+k$ for some integer $k$. Then $\dfrac xy=\dfrac {y+k}{y+1}=\dfrac {ky+1+k}{y+1}$. Multiplying through by $(y+1),$ we get $$xy = ky + k + y.$$Subtracting $ky$ from both sides, we get \begin{align*} x &amp;= y+1\\ \Rightarrow \frac xy &amp;= y+1. \end{align*} Therefore, both $\dfrac xy$ and $\dfrac{x+1}{y+1}$ are integers. So we need to consider $x \geq 1.$ For $x = y+1,$ we have $\left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\right\}$ pairs of positive integers where $x \leq 100.$ As we found later, these are the pairs that work. So we must count $\left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\right\}.$ There are $\frac{12 (12}-1) = 111$ possible pairs. For $x = y+2,$ we have $\left\{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 \right\}$, which includes the $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$ given pairs which also work. As we found later, these are the pairs that work. So there are $\frac{20 (20-1) }{2} = 190$ pairs. Also, for $x = y+3,$ we have $\left\{ 3, 6, \ldots, 30\right\}$. Notice each number is repeated twice. Thus there are also 30 such pairs. Finally for $x = y+ 4,$ we have $\left\{4, 7, \ldots, 32\right\}$. As before we will also take into account that each of these is repeated twice.  Therefore, there are 15 such as pairs. So we have $$\left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32\right\}=$$\boxed{117}$$ pairs of positive integers with the above conditions.

We will use the inductive step as our assumption and to get some values to test our inductive step. It seems too many steps and complicated so we would look for a few small ones first. Let's start with 3 and 2. When y = 2, the numbers are $\frac{x(2)}{2+1} = \frac{x(2)}3$ which equals an integer and we see that x can be 1 for this one. Next we try y = 3 for $\frac{x(3)}{3+1} which equals an integer. So, if we take this as the base case we can define the inductive relation like this $$b_n :=\{ x \in \mathbb R \ \ y \le n \ x  =3 n \},$$$$ P(n):$$ ($P(n)$ implies $P(n+1)$ for if there exists x in the range $$\{ x \in [1,n+1] x  \bmod n \} $$ such that $$\frac{b_{n}}{b_{n+1}} \text { is an integer},$$ then $$x is the next possible number in the sequence. Then, to check the validity of the given statement, we need to show that in $x  = b_{n+1} $ and $y  =2b_{n+1}$ that  $\frac{bx}{by}$  is an integer.  In other words, $$\frac{x(2)}{y +1}$$ gives integer by the definition of our relation. Thus, we get, $$\frac{x(x+1)}{(y+1)(2)}$$ equals integer if and only if x(x+1) divides 2y+2x$$, so the factor (2) must divide the difference between the two $$\text{ i.e., }$, 2(x+1) - 2x = x is divisible by 2. Thus,  it follows that  x is divisible by 2. We can easily see that this is true for every value of y from 2 to some unknown value $$y_0$$ such that $$x = 2y_0$$. If, we can show that the maximum possible value for y is the next possible integer, then we would have finished, as 2n is equal to 100. This would satisfy the statement. Hence, we already have n as 100. Now using casework on y we can show that this is true for all values less than $2 \times 100=200$. Since our answer was 1. there is no need to make $y$ bigger than this in this problem. Therefore, the solution in this case would be, $$\boxed{100}.$$

Generated completion: ## Step 1: Analyze the problem statement
We need to find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ where $y < x \leq 100$, both of which are integers.

## Step 2: Rewrite the conditions for $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be integers
For $\frac xy$ and $\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ to be integers, $x$ must be divisible by $y+1$ and $(y+1)$ must divide $xy$.

## Step 3: Break down the conditions into two parts to solve the system of congruences
This can be expressed by writing $x = qy+r$ for some integer $q$ and $r$ and $(y+1)r \mid qy.$

## Step 4: Analyze the divisibility condition
Since $r$ and $q$ are both integers, $r$ must also be divisible by $q.$ Therefore, we have $y \ge r.$

## Step 5: Replace r by (y+1) using the fact that y < x for $y = qy + 1$
If $q = y+1$ and $y = r$ then, since $y < x \leq 100,$ we get that $y < \frac{x}{y+1} \leq 101.$

## Step 6: Use this to find possible values of $(y+1), r, x$
For $y \ge 1$, it must be the case that $y+1 \le 100$ and for $y = qy+r$, $y+1 \le 100,$ this gives that $qy \le 99$ and we get 99 - 1 pairs (0 to 98).

## Step 7: Analyze the possible pairs of (y,q)
Since $q$ is the only possible value for $y$, the possible values of $\{y,r\}$ for $y = 0,1,2,...,98$ are (0,1),(1,2),(2,3),...(98,99), then by taking y+1 as the new variable for each, the pairs become (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),...(98,99).

## Step 8: Count the pairs of $(y,q) i.e. pairs (y+1,r)$
Since we know $y \ge r$, every pair $(y+1,r)$ is also a valid solution for y = r is true for all pairs of (y, r). Since $q$ ranges from 0 to 98 we can count the distinct pairs for all values of $y$ from 0 to 98 to get our final count of valid pairs $(x,y)$. For our case, there are 99 values of $y-r$ which yield this condition.



## Step 9: Finally we add both pairs
Thus the total count of pairs is (98*99)/2.

First, we note that if $\frac xy$ is an integer, then it follows that $x$ must have the prime factorization $p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}...$, which means that $y=\frac{p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}...}{p_n^{k_n}}$. Next, we can assume that $\frac{x+1}{y+ 1}$ is an integer. We have $\frac{x+1}{y+1}=a$ or $\frac{x+1}{y+1}=b,$ meaning that $x+1=ay+ay+ a$ or $x+1=b(y+1)$. We are getting that \begin{align*} 2a&=b+1\\ b+1&=x+ay\\ a &\ne0 \end{align*}, so $x=a+(b-1)y.$ Now since both $x$ are positive integers, $x+a$ will be a multiple of $a$ and therefore $b+1$ is a multiple of $a(a-2)$. The greatest possible value of $b+1$ is when $a=1$ with $a-2=0$ from which we get $b=1$, and we also get $a=2$. The ordered pairs $(x,y)$ when $x=a+(b-1)y$ is then $(a +b,ab)$ with $(1,1),(a, a-1)$.

Generated completion: <think> Since \[\frac{xy}{y+1} = \frac{x}{y}\cdot y + \frac{1}{y+1},\] we see that $x+1$ is a divisor of $y(y+1).$ Thus, either $x+1$ divides $y$ and $y+1,$ or $x+1$ is $y(y+1).$

For the first case, suppose $x+1 = qy,$ where $q$ is some positive integer. Then, \[\frac xy = \frac{qy}{q}.\] Clearly, this does not result in an integer for any integer values of $x.$ Hence, this case does not lead to a valid solution.

For the second case, suppose $x+1 = y(y+1).$ Since $y<y\le100,$ it follows that $1<y+1<100,$ which means $q<100.$ Since $q$ is positive, the only possible values for $q$ are $2,3,4,5,\dots,99.$ We will thus compute the number of solutions to the equations $$x\equiv y\equiv -1 \pmod{y+1}\pmod{q}$$ for each of these values of $q,$ and count the one's that are valid.

The first equation, $xquiv y,$ has solutions $\{4, 9, 14, 19,\dots\},$ since $11\cdot 9 = 99,$ as well as $15\cdot 16 = 240.$ Furthermore, the second equation gives valid solutions $q = 4,5,6,7,8,10.$

Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the problem
Let's start by understanding the sequence given in the problem. We have a recursive definition for the sequence $a_n$, where $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 5$, and $a_2 = 8$, and for $n > 2$, $a_{n}$ is the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by $11$. We need to find the product $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$.

## Step 2: Understand the recursive definition
The recursive definition indicates that each term of the sequence $a_n$ is calculated using the previous three terms and the divisor $11$. The calculation $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is taken before taking the remainder when divided by $11$. This process applies to all terms of the sequence $a_n$.

## Step 3: Find a pattern in the sequence
To solve for $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence $a_n$ as it relates to remainders when divided by $11$.

## Step 4: Calculate initial terms to identify the pattern
Start by calculating a few initial terms of the sequence $a_n$ to observe any patterns:
- $a_0 = 2$
- $a_1 = 5$
- $a_2 = 8$
- Calculating further terms using the recursive formula:
- $a_3 = 4(a_2 + a_1 + a_0) = 4(8 + 5 + 2) \mod 11 = 4(15) = 60 \mod 11 = 5$
- $a_4 = 4(a_3 + a_2 + a_1) = 4(5 + 8 + 5) = 4(18) = 72 \mod 11 = 6$
- $a_5 = 4(a_4 + a_3 + a_2) = 4(6 + 5 + 8) = 4(19) = 76 \mod 11 = 10$
- We notice that the sequence seems to be following a pattern related to the properties of modular arithmetic.

## Step 5: Identify the pattern in terms of modular arithmetic
After calculating a few terms using modular arithmetic to find the remainder of each calculation when divided by $11$, we notice that the pattern repeats every $10$ terms in terms of the remainder of the terms:
- $a_0 \mod 11 = 2$
- $a_1 \mod 11 = 5$
- $a_2 \mod 11 = 8$
- $a_3 \mod 11 = 5$
- $a_4 \mod 11 = 6$
- $a_5 \mod 11 = 10$
It becomes apparent that the sequence repeats itself.
As this is a cyclic sequence of remainders, we can see the periodicity of the sequence in terms of remainders, which repeats every $10$ terms. That means we can reduce any term's position in the sequence based on this pattern.

## Step 6: Reduce the problem to a smaller problem
To find $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, we need to determine which term in the sequence $a_n$ corresponds to which terms $2018$, $2020$, and $2022$. We can do this by finding the remainder when each is divided by $10$. Since the $10

## Step 2:  We are given that $a_{0} = 2$, $a_{1} = 5$, and $a_{2} = 8$.
## Step 3:  The recursive definition states that $a_{n}$ is the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by 11. This means that we can calculate the sequence of $a_n$ using the previous three terms.
## Step 4:  Let's start by calculating $a_3$, which requires us to find the remainder of $(4(5 + 2 + 1) \bmod 11)$. This simplifies to $13 \equiv 7 \bmod 11$, and then $7 \cdot 2 \equiv a_3 \bmod 11$, leading to $a_3 = 14 \equiv 3 \bmod 11$.
## Step 5:  Continuing this process for $a_{4}$, we have $a_4 = (25 + 8 + 3 \bmod 11) \equiv 8 \bmod 11$, which gives us $a_4 = 8$.
## Step 6:  Now we notice a pattern in the sequence: $a_{0} = 2$, $a_{1} = 5$, $a_{2} = 8$, $a_{3} = 3$, and $a_{4} = 8$. Using this pattern, we can simplify $a_{5}$ and $a_{6}$.
## Step 7:  This yields $a_5$ to be the remainder of $(4(5 + 8 + 2) \bmod 11)$ which is equal to $a_4$.
## Step 8:  This gives us a better understanding of how the sequence evolves, indicating that $a_n = 8$ for all $n \geq 5$.
## Step 9:  We can now verify the value of $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$ using this pattern.
## Step 10:  By applying the pattern, we can express $a_{2018}$ as $8$, $a_{2020}$ as $8$, and $a_{2022}$ as $8$.
## Step 11:  Then, we need to calculate the product of $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$ which is equal to $8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 512$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{512}$
Generated completion: <a think> We can start by looking at the first few terms in the sequence to see if we can spot a pattern. The first few terms are: 2, 5, 8, 11, 18, 29, 47. The sequence now looks like it is formed by adding 3, 13, 19, 18, 14, 32, and so on (or sometimes starting from the 8th number: 59), 77. It looks like we can define a relationship between the terms and a recurrence equation.

<a think> Let's define $a_{n}= 18 + n$, $11 + (n-3 + 18 + n - (n-3))$.

The first term in the sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2},...$ are $2$, 5, 8, 11

By definition, we obtain the pattern:
$2 = a_{0}$
5 = a_{1}$
8 = a_{2}$
11 = a_{3}$
18 = a_{4}$
29 = a_{5}$
47 = a_{6}$
59 = a_{7}$
77 = a_{8}$
91 = a_{9}$

We can write out these relationships from a recurrence to see that
$$
a_{3} = a_{2} + 3 = 11 + 3
$$
$$
a_{4} = a_{3} + 4 = 11 + 4 + 3
$$
$$
a_{5} = a_{4} + 5 = 11 + 4 + 3 + 5
$$
$$
a_{6} = a_{5} + 6 = 11 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6
$$
$$
a_{7} = a_{6} + 7 = 11 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7
$$
$$
a_{8} = a_{7} + 8 = 11 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
$$

So the general solution is $$ a_n = 11 + n + (n -3)$ $

We have a new recurrence.

<a think> Now let's use this recurrence to find $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$.

## Step 1: Applying the recurrence relationship to find $a_{2018}$.
To find $a_{2018}$, we substitute $n = 2018$ into the formula and use the recurrence relationship $a_n = 11 + 2018 + (2018-3)$.

$$
a_{2018}= 11 + 2018 + (2018 - 3)
$$

$$
a_{2018}=11 + 2018 + 2015
$$

## Step 2: Now, apply the recurrence relationship to find $a_{2020}$.
To find $a_{2020}$, we substitute $n = 2020$ into the formula and use the recurrence relationship $a_n = 11 + 2020 + (2020-3)$.

$$
a_{2020}= 11 + 2020 + (2020-3)
$$

$$
a_{2020}=11 + 2020 + 2017
$$

## Step 3:  Now, apply the recurrence relationship to find $a_{2022}$.
To find $a_{2022}$, we substitute $n = 2022$ into the formula and use the recurrence relationship $a_n = 11 + 2022 + (2022-3)$.

Then we notice that $a_{1} = 5$ has a remainder of 3 when divided by 11.$

So $a_{1}  mod 11 = 3. We notice that now that $a_{1}$ does have a remainder of 3 when divided by 11, we can observe a repeating sequence, with remainders of 3, 4, 8, 7, 4, 3.... We can now deduce that every integer k for any n >= 0 such that n is 1 more than a multiple of 6 will have a remainder of 1, given the sequence shown above. Therefore, we let b be any integer such that $n = 6k + 1$ for some integer k in the set of integers whose remainders are 0, 1, 4, 7, 2, and 5 respectively. It follows that $a_{n} = b + d$ for some integer d in the set {0, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3} for every n not equal to 2k for any integer k in the set of integers whose remainders are 0, 1, 4, 7, 2, and 5 respectively.

Now let's work using <think> <answer> </think>

We apply the following induction to prove that the statements above are true:
Step 1:
We show that $a_{2}$ satisfies the above statements. We see that it has a remainder of 8 when divided by 11. Thus, 8 = 11q - 3, so $b + d = 8 = 11q - 3,$ and it follows that b + d = 8, which means b and d are both equal to 3.  So  $a_{2} = b + d$ is the remainder when 4 $(a_{1} + a_{0} + a_{- 3}) $ is divided by 11 which has a remainder of 8, which shows that $a_{2}$ has remainder 8 when divided by 11.
Step 2:
Now that we know $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}, a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}$ all have remainder 3 when divided by 11, we can deduce that any one of $a_{k}$ for any integer k in the set {0, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3} has remainder 3 when divided by 11  So now we let c be any integer that has remainder 0 in the set {0, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3}. We let $n = 6k$ for some integer k in the set of integers such that remainder 0 in the set {0, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3}. By the problem statement, we know $a_{n} = b + d, a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ and $d$ are in the set {0, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3}$ so let m = n-1 we can conclude that $a_{n} = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} = (c + d) + (c + 3) + (c + 7)$.

We are given a recursive sequence $a_{n}$ defined as follows:
- $a_{0} = 2$
- $a_{1} = 5$
- $a_{2} = 8$
- For $n > 2$, $a_{n}$ is the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by $11$.

## Step 2: Calculate initial terms to identify a pattern
To solve for $a_{2018} \cdot a_{2020} \cdot a_{2022}$, we first need to find the pattern in the sequence. Let's calculate a few more terms:
- $a_{3} = 4(a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0}) \mod 11 = 4(8 + 5 + 2) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 15 \mod 11 = 60 \mod 11 = 5$
- $a_{4} = 4(a_{3} + a_{2} + a_{1}) \mod 11 = 4(5 + 8 + 5) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 18 \mod 11 = 72 \mod 11 = 6$
- $a_{5} = 4(a_{4} + a_{3} + a_{2}) \mod 11 = 4(6 + 5 + 8) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 19 \mod 11 = 76 \mod 11 = 10$
- $a_{6} = 4(a_{5} + a_{4} + a_{3}) \mod 11 = 4(10 + 6 + 5) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 21 \mod 11 = 84 \mod 11 = 7$
- $a_{7} = 4(a_{6} + a_{5} + a_{4}) \mod 11 = 4(7 + 10 + 6) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 23 \mod 11 = 92 \mod 11 = 4$
- $a_{8} = 4(a_{7} + a_{6} + a_{5}) \mod 11 = 4(4 + 7 + 10) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 21 \mod 11 = 84 \mod 11 = 7$
- $a_{9} = 4(a_{8} + a_{7} + a_{6}) \mod 11 = 4(7 + 4 + 7) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 18 \mod 11 = 72 \mod 11 = 6$
- $a_{10} = 4(a_{9} + a_{8} + a_{7}) \mod 11 = 4(6 + 7 + 4) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 17 \mod 11 = 68 \mod 11 = 2$
- $a_{11} = 4(a_{10} + a_{9} + a_{8}) \mod 11 = 4(2 + 6 + 7) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 15 \mod 11 = 60 \mod 11 = 5$
- $a_{12} = 4(a_{11} + a_{10} + a_{9}) \mod 11 = 4(5 + 2 + 6) \mod 11 = 4 \cdot 13 \mod 11
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the initial values of the sequence.
The sequence is defined with initial values $a_{0} = 2$, $a_{1} = 5$, and $a_{2} = 8$.

## Step 2: Understand the recursive definition of the sequence.
For any $n > 2$, the term $a_{n}$ is defined as the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by 11.

## Step 3: Compute the first few terms to identify any patterns.
- To find $a_{3}$, we can use the recursive definition: $a_{3} = 4(a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0}) = 4(8 + 5 + 2) = 4(15) = 60 \mod 11 = 5$.
- For $a_{4}$, we compute: $a_{4} = 4(a_{3} + a_{2} + a_{1}) = 4(5 + 8 + 5) = 4(18) = 72 \mod 11 = 6$.
- Continuing this process, we can calculate the next few terms to identify any recurring patterns in the sequence modulo 11.
- Continuing the pattern for $a_{5}$ and beyond should help identify a recurring pattern.

## Step 4: Continue the sequence until a pattern emerges or until we find a value for $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$.
We need to continue applying the recursive definition.
- $a_{5}$ would be the remainder of $4(6 + 55) mod 11$, which is $4(61) = 244 \mod 11 = 7$.
- $a_{6}$ would be the remainder of $4(7 + 8 + 7) = 4(22) = 88$ modulo 11, which is $88 \mod 11 = 2$.
- $a_{7}$ would be the remainder of $4(2 + 2 + 7) = 4(11) = 44$, which is $44 \mod 11 = 0$.
- Since $a_{7} = 0$, $a_{n}$ will start repeating the same values for $n > 7$, because once a term reaches 0, it will keep repeating in the subsequent terms due to the nature of the recursive definition which is based on adding previous terms within the group [n-1, a_{n-2}, a_{n-3}]. This means $a_{n} = 0$ for n > 7 for the given condition to hold.

## Step 5: Find the specific values of $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$.
- $a_{8}$ will follow the pattern and be 0, $a_{9}$ will follow and be 0, and $a_{10}$ will again follow and be 0.
- Therefore, $a_{2018}$, $a_{2020}$, and $a_{2022}$ can all be determined as 0.

## Step 6:  Calculate the product of the found values.
- Given $a_{2018} = 0$, $a_{2020} = 0$, and $a_{2022} = 0$, the product of these values is $0 * 0 * 0 = 0$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Identify the recursive definition of the sequence
The sequence $a_n$ is defined recursively as the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3})$ is divided by $11$. We are given that $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 5$, and $a_2 = 8$.

## Step 2: Calculate the next terms in the sequence to find a pattern
We can calculate a few more terms of the sequence to see if there's a pattern.
- $a_3 = 4(a_2 + a_1 + a_0) = 4(8 + 5 + 2) = 4 \cdot 15 = 60$,
- $a_4 = 4(a_3 + a_2 + a_1) = 4(60 + 8 + 5) = 4 \cdot 73 = 292$.

## Step 3: Continue calculating terms to identify the periodic pattern in the sequence
To identify a pattern, let's compute a few more terms of the sequence modulo 11.
- $a_5 = 4(a_4 + a_3 + a_2) = 4(292 + 60 + 8) = 4 \cdot 360 = 1440 \equiv 1 \mod 11$,
- $a_6 = 4(a_5 + a_4 + a_3) = 4(1 + 292 + 60) \equiv 4 \cdot 354 \equiv 8 \mod 11$,
- $a_7 = 4(a_6 + a_5 + a_4) = 4(8 + 1440 + 292) \equiv 4 \cdot 1702 \equiv 6 \mod 11$,
- $a_8 = 4(a_7 + a_6 + a_5) = 4(6 + 8 + 1) \equiv 4 \cdot 15 \equiv 4 \mod 11$.
## Step 4: Identify the periodicity of the sequence when considering modulo 11
We found that the sequence modulo 11 has a period and that its terms are repeating.

## Step 5: Identify the period of the sequence
Since $a_0 = 2$, $a_1 = 5$, $a_2 = 8$, and the next term repeats $10$ steps after $a_3$ with the same residues $(\mod11)$, we find that $a_{10} = a_2 \equiv 8 \mod 11$ and $a_{11} = a_3 \equiv  60 \equiv 8 \mod 11$, therefore $\{a_n\}_{n = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, 13,14,15,16,17,18\}$ has period 10.

## Step 6: Apply the identified pattern to find $a_{2018}$ and $a_{2020}$ and $a_{2022}$
Given that $2018 = 2016 + 2$, $2020 = 2018 + 2$, and $2022 = 2019 + 3$, we have that $a_{2018} = a_{\overline{2019}}$, $a_{2020}$ can be directly mapped from $a_0$ $a_{2021}$ is the same as $a_1$ and so on, since their differences are in some multiple of 10. Therefore,  $a_{2018} \equiv 2\mod 11$. Similarly,  since $

To find $a_{n}$, we use the recursive formula $a_{n}$ is the remainder when $4(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$) is divided by 11.

## Step 3: Calculate $a_{3}$
For $n = 3$, we calculate $a_{3} = 4(a_{2} + a_{1} + a_{0}) \mod 11$. Substituting the given values, we get $a_{3} = 4(8 + 5 + 2) \mod 11 = 4(15) \mod 11 = 60 \mod 11 = 5$.

## Step 4: Calculate $a_{4}$
For $n = 4$, we calculate $a_{4} = 4(a_{3} + a_{2} + a_{1}) \mod 11$. Substituting the values, we get $a_{4} = 4(5 + 8 + 5) \mod 11 = 4(18) \mod 11 = 72 \mod 11 = 6$.

## Step 5: Calculate $a_{5}$
For $n = 5$, we calculate $a_{5} = 4(a_{4} + a_{3} + a_{2}) \mod 11$. Substituting the values, we get $a_{5} = 4(6 + 5 + 8) \mod 11 = 4(19) \mod 11 = 76 \mod 11 = 10$.

## Step 6: Calculate $a_{6}$
For $n = 6$, we calculate $a_{6} = 4(a_{5} + a_{4} + a_{3}) \mod 11$. Substituting the values, we get $a_{6} = 4(10 + 6 + 5) \mod 11 = 4(21) \mod 11 = 84 \mod 11 = 7$.

## Step 7: Calculate $a_{7}$
For $n = 7$, we calculate $a_{7} = 4(a_{6} + a_{5} + a_{4}) \mod 11$. Substituting the values, we get $a_{7} = 4(7 + 10 + 6) \mod 11 = 4(23) \mod 11 = 92 \mod 11 = 6$.

## Step 8: Identify the pattern in the sequence modulo 11.
From the initial values of $a_{3} = 5$, $a_{4} = 6$, $a_{5} = 10$, $a_{6} = 7$, $a_{7} = 6$, the cycle seems to produce 5, 6, 10, 6, and then it repeats.

## Step 9: Calculate $a_{8}$, $a_{9}$ and $a_{10}$ to confirm the pattern.
Using the recursive formula for $n = 8$, we get $a_{8} = 4(a_{7} + a_{6} + a_{5}) \mod 11 = 4(6 + 7 + 10) \mod 11 = 4(23) \mod 11 = 92 \mod 11 = 6$. Then for $n = 9

Text of step 1: The first equation can be rewritten using the change of base formula for logarithms:   $\log_b{a} = \frac{\log_c{a}}{\log_c{b}}$. This gives us $\frac{\log{225}}{\log{64}} + \frac{\log{y}}{\log{x}} = 4$.

## Step 2: Simplify the first equation
$\frac{\log{225}}{\log{64}} = \frac{\log{25^2}}{\log{4^6}} = \frac{2\log{25}}{6\log{4}}$. Using the property of logarithm that $\log{a^b} = b\log{a}$, the equation becomes: $\frac{2(\log{5^2})}{6\log{4}} = \frac{2 \cdot 2\log{5}}{6\log{4}} = \frac{4\log{5}}{6\log{4}}$.

## Step 3: Simplify the first equation
$\frac{\frac{4\log{5}}{6\log{4}} = \frac{4 \log{5}}{2\log{2}} \times \frac{\log{2}}{\log{2}} = \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}$

## Step 4: Simplify the second equation using the change of base formula
$\frac{\log{64}}{\log{x}} - \frac{\log{225}}{\log{y}}= 1$ becomes $\frac{\log{8}}{\log{x}} - \frac{\log{15}}{\log{y}} = 1$.

## Step 5: Get the common denominator for the second equation and combine
$\frac{\log{8y}-\log{15x}}{\log{xy}} = 1$.

## Step 6: Subtract the two simplified equations
$\frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}} - \frac{\log{15x}}{\log{xy}} = 0$

$\frac{\log 5 - \log{15x}}{\log{x}\log{y}} = 0$.

## Step 7: Simplify the fraction
This implies that $\log{x\log{y}} = \log{15}$. Taking the reciprocal gives that $\log{y} = \frac{\log{15}}{\log{x}}$.

## Step 8: Plug a value for $\log{x}$ from the first equation
In the first equation  $\frac{\log{25}}{\log{64}} = \frac{2 \log{5}}{6 log{4}}$ then if we let  $\log{5} = 2 \log{4}$
$\log{x} = \log{20} = 2 \log{5} = 2 \log{2^2}$.
In equation $\log{x}$
$\log{x} = 4 \log{5} =  4 \log{2^2}$

We start by expressing $\log_{225}{x}+\log_{64}{y} = 4$ in a more manageable form as $\log_{225}{x^4} + \log_{64}{y^4} = \log_{225*64}{(x^4y^4) = 4$ which simplifies to $\log_{(225*64)}{(x^4y^4)} = 4$. Next, we can use the change of base formula to rewrite this as $\log_{30}{(x^4y^4) = 4$, applying the change of base formula results in $\frac{\log{x^4y^4}}{\log{30}} = 4$.

## Step 2: Apply the property of logarithms to simplify the equation.
Using the property of logarithms, $\log_a{b^c} = c\log_ab$, rewrite the equation as $\frac{4\log{(x*y)} = 4$ which simplifies to $4\log{(x*y)} = 4$.

## Step 3: Solve for $\log{(x*y)}$.
Divide both sides of the equation by 4, yielding $\log{(x*y)} = 1$. We now have the value of $\log{(x*y)}$.

## Step 4: Isolate the variables $x$ and $y$.
Now we can find the values of $x$ and $y$. Since $y = e^1$, $y = e$. Let $x=225$.

## Step 5: Now we can substitute these values into one of the original equations to solve for the other variable.
Substituting the values into the second equation $\log_{x}{225}- \log_{y}{64} = 1$, we get $\log_{225}{225}- \log_{e}{64} = 1$.

## Step 6: Since $\log_a{a} = 1$, simplify $\log_{225}{225} - \log_{e}{64}$ to $1 - \log_{64} 64 = 1 - 1 = 0$, $\log_{225}{225} - \log_{e}{64}$ = 0, which simplifies to $\frac{\log165}{\log{225}} = 0$.

## Step 7: To find $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2}$, we multiply the values we found in step 3 and $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2}$, we can substitute the given values into $y_1 = 225$ and $y_2 = 64$.

## Step 8: $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1y_2 y_2)}$ = log_{30}(225*64*225*64) =  log_{30}(225*64^3) = log_{30}( 27*1048576)$.

## Step 9: We simplify this by finding the value of $\log_{30 }(30*108864)$ by expressing $30$ as $30^{\log_{108864}1}$. This can be applied to each factor separately.

## Step 10: $\log_{(30*108864)}90$  to rewrite this expression to $\log_{30}(90)$. $\log_{(30*108864)}90$ = $\log_{(30*108864)}(30 * 3*3608)$ = $\log_{30}(30) +\log_{30}(108864)$

Since $\log{64} = \log 2^6$, we can rewrite this equation as $\frac{3 \log 5}{\log 2^6} + \frac{4 \log 2}{\log 2^6} = 4$. This simplifies to $\frac{3\log 5 + 4\log 2}{6 \log 2} = 4$. Multiplying through by $6 \log 2,$ we get $3\log 5 + 4\log 2 = 24\log 2$, so $3\log 5 = 20\log 2$.

## Step 3: Let $x=15.5885$; we can now use this in the second equation to find the values for x and y.
We start with the second equation $\log_{x}{225}- \log_{y}{64} = 1$, to solve for $x$ we can let $y = 30$ and substitute to get $\log_{30}{225}- \log_{30}{64} = 1$. Since $\log_{30}{64} = \frac{\log 64}{\log 30}$, we can rewrite this equation as $\frac{\log 225}{\log 30} - \log_{30}{64} = 1$, or $\frac{3\log 5}{\log 30} - 1 = 1$. So we get $\frac{3\log 5}{\log 30} = 2$, which, taking the reciprocal of both sides, gives us $\log 30 = \frac{\log 5}{\log 3}$. Therefore we can find $x$. This can be expressed as $\log_{x}{15.5885}$.

## Step 4: To find $\log_{x}{15.5885}$ we can let $x = y=5$ and substitute to get $\log_{5}{15.5885}- \log_{5}{64} = 1$. We already know that $\log_{5}{64} = \frac{\log 64}{\log 5}$ and $\log_{5}{64} = \frac{\log 2^6}{\log 5} = \frac{6 \log 2}{\log 5}$. So we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{3 \log 2}{\log 5} - \frac{6 \log 2}{\log 5} = 1$. Multiplying through by $\log 5$, we get $\frac{3 \log 2}{\log 5} - \frac{6 \log 2}{\log 5} = \frac{6\log 2}{\log 5}$. Solving for $\frac{\log 2}{\log 5
Generated completion: ## Step 1: First, let's analyze the given system of equations.
We have \begin{align*} \log_{225}{x}+\log_{64}{y} = 4\\ \log_{x}{225}- \log_{y}{64} = 1 \end{align*}. We need to solve this system of logarithmic equations to find $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$.

## Step 2: Let's try to simplify the first equation by using the properties of logarithms.
We can use the property $\log_a{b} + \log_a{c} = \log_a{(b \cdot c)}$. Applying this to the first equation gives $\log_{225}{(x \cdot y)} = 4$.

## Step 3: Similarly, simplify the second equation using the same property.
Using the same property, we get $\log_{x}{(x \cdot 64)} - \log_{y}{(64 \cdot 25)} = 1$.

## Step 4: Now, let's simplify each log equation into exponential form.
Converting these into exponential form gives $225^{4} = x \cdot y$ and $x^2 \cdot 64 = 64 \cdot 25 = 1600$.

## Step 5: Let's solve the equations to find the product $x \cdot y$.
Solving the equations, we get $x = \frac{1600}{225} = \frac{32}{4} = 80$ and $y = \frac{225}{64}$.

## Step 6: We need to find $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$, so we have to multiply $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ to find the answer.
$(x_1, y_1) = (80, \frac{225}{64})$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (80, \frac{225}{64})$.

## Step 7: Substitute the values of $x$ and $y_1$ and $y_2$ into the original equation $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$.
$\log_{30}\left(80\left(\frac{225}{64}\right) \cdot 80\left(\frac{225}{64}\right)\right)$.

## Step 8: Simplify the expression inside the logarithm.
$80\left(\frac{225}{64}\right) = \frac{18000}{64}$ and $\left(\frac{225}{64}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{225}{64}\right)^2 = \frac{50625}{4096}$. Now the expression is $\log_{30}{\frac{18000}{64} \cdot \frac{50625}{4096}}$.

## Step 9:  Now we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm to find $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$.
To simplify $18000 \cdot 50625$ we get $9180000$, then we can use $\log_{30} 9180000$.

## Step 10: To simplify the denominator of the logarithm we have to find the prime factors of the base $30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$ that would make the whole expression smaller
Since this has been simplified $30^{log_{2} (9180000)/log_{2}30$.
$\log_{2} (9180000) = log_{2} ((2^3 * 3^4 * 5^5)).
\end{align
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We need to solve the system of logarithmic equations given and find the value of $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$. The first equation is $\log_{225}{x}+\log_{64}{y} = 4$, and the second equation is $\log_{x}{225}- \log_{y}{64} = 1$.

## Step 2: Applying Logarithmic Properties to the Equations
We can start by using the property of logarithms $\log_{a}{b}+\log_{a}{c} = \log_{a}{bc}$ to simplify the first equation to $\log_{225}{(x \cdot y)} = 4$.

## Step 3: Solving the Simplified First Equation
Raising 225 to the power of both sides gives us $(x \cdot y) = 225^4$.

## Step 4: Applying Logarithmic Properties to the Second Equation
We can apply the same property $\log_{a}{b} - \log_{a}{c} = \log_{a}{\frac{b}{c}}$ to simplify the second equation to $\log_{x}{(225)} - \log_{y}{64} = 1 = \log_{x}{\frac{225}{64}}$.

## Step 5: Using Logarithmic Equivalence
We can further simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by $x$ and $y$, then applying the property $\log_{b}{m} - \log_{b}{n} = \log_{b}{\frac{m}{n}}$, resulting in $\log_{x}{\frac{225}{64}} = \log_{x}{\frac{x}{y^2}}$.

## Step 6: Using the Quotient Property of Logs
Since we're looking for $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$, let's examine the relationship we can form from the equation we now have, $\log_{x}{\frac{x}{y^2}} = \log_{x}{\frac{225}{64}}$. This means when we compare the bases and the argument, we can recognize that both $\frac{225}{64}$ is a power of our original bases ($225 = 25^2$ and $64 = 4^3$), so we can rewrite $\log_{x}{\frac{225}{64}} = \log_{x}{25^2}$.

## Step 7: Applying Base Change Equation
To change the base to 30 to match our initial equation for $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$, we can use $\log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}$. Therefore, we can find $\log_{30}{x}$ and $\log_{30}{y}$ using $\log_{25^2}{x}$ and $\log_{64}{y}$ by substituting $x = 25^2$ and $y = 64$ for $\log_{25^2}{x}$ and $\log_{64}{y}$ respectively.

## Step 8: Finding log's for the Values of $x$ and $y$
To simplify $\log_{25^2}{x} = \frac{\log_{40}{x}}{\log_{40}{(25^2)} = \frac{\log_{40}{x}}{2}$ similarly for $\log_{64}{y} = \frac{\log_{40}{y}}{2}$. So we now have $\frac{\log_{40}{x}}{2} = \frac{\log_{40}{225^2}}{2}$ which leads to $\frac{\log_{40
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Let's start by using the definition of logarithms to rewrite the given system of equations in terms of exponents.
We have $\log_{225}{x} = \frac{\log{x}}{\log{225}}$ and $\log_{64}{y} = \frac{\log{y}}{\log{64}}$. We can also express $225=5^2\cdot 3^2$, and $64=4\cdot 16$, so we can rewrite the system of equations as: $\frac{\log{x}}{2\log{3}} + \frac{\log{y}}{\log{4}} = 4$ and $\frac{\log{y}}{\log{x}} - \frac{\log{64}}{\log{4}} = 1$.

## Step 2: Multiply both sides of each equation by $2\log{3}\cdot\log{4}$ to clear the fractions, in order to simplify and make calculations easier.
We get $\log{3}\log{x}+2\log{4}\log{y} = 8\log{3} \log{4}$ and $\log{4}\log{x} - \log{3}\log{4} \log{64} = \log{3}\log{4}$.

## Step 3: We can now subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the logarithms on the right-hand side and solve for $\log{x} \log{y}$.
We have $(\log{3}\log{x} + 2\log{4}\log{y}) - (\log{4}\log{x} - \log{3}\log{4}\log{64}) = 8\log{3}\log{4}$, which simplifies to $(\log{3}\log{x} + \log{3}\log{4}\log{64}) + (\log{4}\log{y} + 2\log{4}\log{4}) - (\log{4}\log{x} - \log{3}\log{4}^3) = 8\log{3}\log{4}$.

## Step 4: Using properties of logarithms, we can further simplify the expression to $\log{x}\log{4^2} + \log{3}\log{y} + 2\log{4}\log{4} - \log{x}\log{y} - \log{3}\log{4}^3 = 8\log{4}\log{3}$.

## Step 5: Continue simplifying to isolate $\log{x}\log{y}$ to $\log{x}\log{4} (\log{4}+2-\log{3}) = 8\log{3}\log{4}-\log{3} \log{4}^3$.

## Step 6: Factoring out $\log{4} \log{4} -\log{3}$ from both sides of the equation gives $(\log{x}\log{4} - \log{3}) (\log{4} + 2) = 8\log{3}\log{4}-\log{3} \log{4}^3$.

## Step 7: The $\log{4}$'s cancel out and we get $\log{x}\log{4} - \log{3} = 8\log{3}\log{4}-\log{3} \log{4}^3$.

## Step 8: We subtract $\log{3} \log{4}^3$ from both sides, and the $\log{3} \log{4}$ on both sides, yielding $\log{x}\log{4} = 8\log{3}\log{4}
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Analyze the given equations to identify any symmetries or transformations that can help simplify the problem.
We start by examining the given system of equations, which are logarithmic equations with different bases. We can utilize properties of logarithms to simplify the expressions.

## Step 2: Apply the change-of-base formula to transform logarithms with different bases into a common base, such as base 10 or 25, to facilitate simplification.
To simplify the given system, we can apply the change-of-base formula for logarithms, which states that $\log_b a = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}$ for any positive numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ where $b \neq c$. Applying this formula, we obtain the system of equations $\log_{225}{x} = \frac{\log_{10}{x}}{\log_{10}{(225)}}$ and $\log_{64}{y} = \frac{\log_{10}{y}}{\log_{10}{(64)}}$.

## Step 3: Simplify the system of equations obtained from the change-of-base formula.
We know that $\log_{10}{225} = 2\log_{10}{3}$ and $\log_{10}{64} = \log_{10}{4^3} = 3\log_{10}{4}$. Substituting these values, the simplified form of the equations becomes $\log_{225}{x} = \frac{\log_{10}{x}}{2\log_{10}{3}}$ and $\log_{64}{y} = \frac{\log_{10}{y}}{3\log_{10}{4}}$.

## Step 4: Use the given system of equations and the properties of logarithms to find expressions for x and y that can be used to calculate $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$.
Let's denote $t = \log_{x}{y}$. Then, from the second equation we have $y = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^t$. Now, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation to obtain $\log_{225}{x} = \frac{\log_{10}{(x/4^t)}}{2\log_{10}{3}}$, which simplifies to $\log_{225}{x} = \frac{\log_{10}{x} - \log_{10}{4^t}}{2\log_{10}{3}}$.

## Step 5: From the simplified equation obtained from the substitution, solve the system to find expressions for x and t.
Now we have $\frac{x}{64} = \left(\frac{x}{4^t}\right)^2$. By multiplying out the terms on the right side, we get $\frac{x}{64} = \frac{x^2}{16^t}$. Equating the numerators and comparing denominators, we find that $16^t = 64$, which implies $t = 2$. Since $t$ is the same in both equations, we can use the first equation to find $x$ using the value of $t = 2$.

## Step 6: Substitute the value of x obtained from t back into expressions for x and y to find y.
Using the obtained value for t, we have $x = 4^{2t} = 4^4 = 256$ and we can easily find y using $y = \left(\frac{256}{64}\right)^2 = 4^2 = 16$.

## Step 7: Calculate $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$.
To find $\log_{30}{(x_1y_1x_2y_2)}$, we can substitute
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Convert the first equation into exponential form
The first equation can be rewritten using the logarithm exponential form as follows: $225^{log_{225}{x} + log_{64}{y}} = 225^4$.

## Step 2: Rewrite the bases in terms of a common denominator
We rewrite 225 and 64 as powers of $x$. Since $225= x^2$, we can simplify the equation to: $(x^2)^{log_{x}{225}} + 64^{log_{x}{225}} = (x^2)^4$.

## Step 3: Simplify the equation
Simplifying, we get $x^{log_x{225}} + x^{log_x{64}} = x^4$.

## Step 4: Solve for $x$ and $y$ in the first equation
By taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get $x^{-log_x{64} + log_x{225}} + x^{-log_x{225} + log_x{64}} = 1/x^4$. By simplifying further, we get $\frac{1}{x^{log_x{64/225}}}+\frac{1}{x^{log_2x}}= \frac{1}{x^{-4}x^4}$.

## Step 5: Simplify and find a common denominator for the fractions in the equation
Multiplying both sides by $x^{-4}x^4$ to clear the fractions and $x^{-log_x{64/225}}=\frac{1}{ (log_x{64}-log_x{225})}$ and $(1 / x^{-log_x{225} + log_x{64}/x^{-4}x^4 + ((-1 / log_x{64}-log_x{27}) x^4))=30 $.

## Step 6: Simplify the right side of the equation to match the required format
Thus $(x^{-4}+ 1/x^{-log_x{64}}+(-1/(log_x{64}-log_x{225}))=30$.

## Step 7: Find a common denominator for the equation
The common denominator for $x$ and $64$, $x$, $225$, and $64$ will result 900 in the above equation where $log_x{64}-log_x{225}=log_x{(64^{log_x{64})/  225}}=3/5$.

## Step 8: Let $u = x^{-1/5}, $ then transform the equation into  a higher-powered expression of x and y.
Let $x^{-4}+u^{-5} +u^{-21+5/4)=30$. Then add $\frac{100}{x^4(x^{log_x{64 / 225})^4}$ to both sides.

## Step 9: Simplify and reorganize the equation
Rewrite it as  $\frac{x^{log_x{64^4}}{x^4( 64^{log_225/4})} + 100} = x^{-1}$. So $\frac{( x^{log_x{64^4}*x^-1)^{-1/4}*x^4 }{ ( log_{225} x^-1 * log_{64} x^5)}=30$. So, the expression for this equation becomes, $\frac{ (x^{-log_x{64}-x^{-1/4}x^4* x^5)^4 /log_225xlog_64x^5*  x^1 } =30$.  Further simplification yields, $\frac{(x^{ 4*5)4} \ln x^{-4+5/4} *  x^{1} }{ log_225x(log_64x)} = 30 \ln x^4$. Further simpl

Generated completion: <think> The hexagon $OABCDEF$ has two sides parallel to the imaginary axis: $OZ$ and $DF$. Each of these segments has a length of 1 unit. The hexagon has six sides, each of length 1, and it lies on the real and imaginary axes. Since any point $M$ on segment $OZE$ is equidistant from $O, E$, and $Z$, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment $OZ$, which intersects the real axis at its midpoint \[- \frac{1}{2}, \;0. \] Similarly, any point $L$ on segment $DF$ is on the line $\overline{OF}, which intersects the real axis at $\frac{1}{2}.$ Since points $M$ and $L$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of segment $OZ$, their distances are the same. Thus $M,L$, and $X$ are equidistant from line $OF$. Using the 2:1 ratio theorem, we can easily find that a line $PAB$ perpendicular $PF$ divides $R$ into two regions. If we connect $R$ with $P A B$ and $O H$ then $RH \cong AB$ in $\triangle HAB$, since they are congruent (angle-angle-side, ASA), and $RH \cong PH$ (line-segments). As a result, RH is congruent to HA in triangles $\triangle HOB$ and $\triangle HOP$. Thus $RH + \; PH = OH + HP$.
Generated completion: <think> The problem has three sides: horizontal  and two of vertical. It's easier to solve this problem if we plot it on the complex plane, with the origin at the center. Also, the center is $t$ units away from the center of the circle, meaning $|t|=1$. Since the hexagon is regular with sides of length 1, it can be expressed in terms of an equation in polar coordinates.
Let the points $(e^{\pi i/6}$, $\sqrt{3}$ ) and $(e^{\pi i/6}$, -$\sqrt{3}$) be vertices of the hexagonal unit cell. Let $O$ be the origin of the unit circle. Then we have $\frac{1}{1+z/2} = \frac{1+z/2+t}{1+z/2}$, so $$1 = \frac{1}{1+t}$$This gives $t=1$, and $R=\frac{\sqrt{3}+i\pi}{2}.$ We can make use of the concept of polar and rectangular conversion, and also of the fact that we can express $S$ in polar form for this problem. By substituting $z=x+iy$ for $u$, $dz=i(-d x,dy)$ and $R(u,z)$ for $z$ into the equation of $S$, and then using polar coordinates the equation for $S$ simplifies to $R(u) = \frac{\sqrt{3}+u}{\sqrt{(1+u)^2+\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{2+u}$.
Letting $z = 2u$ makes this a bit easier to solve:
$$
\begin{aligned}
R(2u) &= \frac{1}{2+2u} \\
&: (1-u)R(2u) &= 1 \\
R(2u) &= \frac{1}{1-u} \\
&= \frac{1}{1+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} u}
\end{aligned}
$$
This form helps you to see that $\frac{1}{1-u}$ comes from the difference of squares. The denominator will always be $\sqrt{4u^2-2u+\frac{\sqrt{3}u}{2}}$, and the numerator will always be $(2-u^2)$, giving you a formula to use for $R(u)$ in terms of just $u$.

Taking the square root of both sides gives $R(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-u)^2-2u+\frac{\sqrt{3}u}{2}}} = \frac{2}{1-u+\sqrt{2u-1}}$. Therefore,
$$\begin{aligned}
S& = Re^{2u}\\
& = e^u(1-u)\\
& = e^u-ue^u
\end{aligned}
$$

Then we can simply let $u = x + iy$ and rewrite our equation as $$S = e^{x+iy} - e^{x-iy}.$$
Let's express $z = e^x + ie^iy$ and $z = e^x - ie^iy$ in exponential form. They are of the same form but opposite directions.

Let $z = e^x + ie^iy$. Take the complex conjugate of both sides and we get, $-z = e^{-x} - ie^-y$. Multiply both sides by -1, we get $$\overline{z} = -e^x + e^iy.$$
As $\overline{\overline{z}}=z$, this equation becomes $-\overline

Since one of the pair of sides of the hexagon is parallel to the imaginary axis, it must be an equilateral triangle.
This is because each internal angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°, and the angle between opposite sides is 60°. Thus,$\angle AOB=120^{\circ}$
Since the area of the hexagon $A_1$ is equivalent to the sum of the areas of these equilateral triangles, we may find the ratio between the areas of the hexagon and the equilateral triangle. The triangle has side length $1$, therefore its area is $$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.$$
Therefore:

## Step 2:  Next, we are asked to find the area of the region R outside the hexagon. We can begin by defining a point P = (cosθ, sinθ) with 0 < θ < π, such that the line joining P to L is perpendicular to the imaginary axis and 1 unit long. We can then rewrite this line in the form e^iθ and  be the end point.

## Step 3:  We can then solve for the area of the region R using the formula for the area of the sector of a circle.

## Step 4:  We can express the area of the region R in terms of θ and then express the area of the hexagon as the difference between the area of the sector and the area of the equilateral triangles.

## Step 5:  Then we need to express the ratio of the areas of the sector of the circle and the two equilateral triangles and use this ratio to determine the area of the hexagon.

## Step 6:  We can obtain the expression for the area of the hexagon in terms of θ and further simplify it to be in the form a π + √b.

## Step 7:  By comparing this expression with the required form, we can deduce the values of a and b.

## Step 8:  So, the area of the hexagon has the form a π + √b.

## Step 9:  To find the values of a and b, we can obtain a and b from the expression.

## Step 10:  Finally, we need to add a and b to obtain the sum asked for in the problem statement.

Generated completion: Think < reasoning process > Given that the hexagon is regular with one pair of sides being parallel to the imaginary axis, the hexagon forms 6 equilateral triangles of side 1 in the complex plane. We denote the center of the hexagon by O, and denote the vertices by (z1, z2,..., zn). By drawing the figure above, it can be seen that the equation of the circle containing $O$ is $z^2 + z^2 +... + z^2 = (0 + 0i)^2 = 0$, implying that O is 1 unit away from each of the vertices. Therefore, $|z| = \sqrt{(0 + 0i)^2}$ = 1. The region $S$ is half of the area of the region $R$, so the radius of circle $S$ is  $\frac 12{\tan\frac{1}{6}} = e^{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Now, we can find $S$.   We must subtract $2\cdot \frac12 \pi$ from each of these so that each point is on the real axis.  This does not affect our result.  The points are  $e^{i\pi/4}, e^{i(5\pi/6 - \pi/2)}, e^{i(7\pi/6 + \pi/2)}, e^{-i\pi/4}, e^{i(5\pi/6 + \pi/2)}, e^{-i(7\pi/6 - \pi/2)}$, and we can see that $e=\frac{1}{2}$.  One of them can be expressed as $\cos 30^\circ +i\sin 30^\circ$. Thus,
 $S=\left(e^{i\pi/4} + e^{i(5\pi/6 - \pi/2)} + e^{i(7\pi/6 + \pi/2)} + e^{-i\pi/4} + e^{i(5\pi/6 + \pi/2)} + e^{-i(7\pi/6 - \pi/2)}\right)$.  By adding the terms, we can get
 $$S= e^{i(\pi - 15\pi/2)} + e^{i(12\pi - 3\pi/2)} = e^{-i\pi/2} + e^{i(7\pi/6)}= \frac12 e^i\frac13\left(2+i+e^{2 i-\pi/3}\right)$$
So we have $S = \frac{1}{2}e^{i\pi/3}\left(2\cos 23^\circ + i \sin 23^\circ+\frac12 e^ {-i\pi/3}\right)$ $$ = \frac{1}{2}e^{i\pi/3}\left(\sqrt{3}\left(\cos 23^\circ +i \sin 23^\circ\right)+e^{-i\pi/3}\left(\cos 23^\circ +i\sin 23^\circ \right)\right)$, which is the form $a\pi + \sqrt{b}$.  We know that $\cos 23^\circ + i\sin 23^\circ = \frac{e^{i\pi/3} + e^{-i\pi/3} }{2}$, and $\frac12 e^{-i\pi/3}\left(\cos 23^\circ +i \sin 23^\circ\right) = \frac12.e^{-i\

Generated completion: To find the value of <think>x=2001</think>, we first analyze the given properties of function f.

The function satisfies the property f(3x) = 3f(x) for all positive real values of x.

Since 2001 = 3(668), applying the given property 3 times, we can write it as:

```<think>f(2001) = 3^2*f(668) = 3^3*f(222) = 3^4*f(74) = 3^5*f(24) = 3^6*f(8) = 3^7*f(2)
</think>

By examining the last equation, we notice that 3^7*f(2) is a multiple of 3. According to the second property given of the function f, we know f(x) = 1 - |x - 2| for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3.

Since 2 = 3 - 1, 3^7*f(2) is a multiple of 3. Thus,

3^7*f(2) = 3^7*1 = 3^7
Therefore, we have 3^7 as a multiple of f(2),

It means for 2001 = 3^7*p, that 2001 must be divisible by p which is 3.

Since 2 is a prime number, we must have p = 1. However, 2001 is not divisible by 2, 3, or any other prime number. 2001 is a Mersenne prime.
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Analyze the given properties of the function
The problem provides a function $f(x$) with two properties: $f(3x) = 3f(x)$ for all positive real values of $x$ and $f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|$ for $1\leq x \leq 3$.

## Step 2: Determine the key behavior of the function for x greater than 3
Since $f(3x) = 3f(x)$ for any positive real number $x$, we can evaluate $f(x)$ for $x > 3$ by expressing $x$ as $3t$, where $t$ is a real number. This implies $f(x) = 3f(3t)$.

## Step 3: Find the relationship between the given function and the required function
To find $f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|, we note that this function is defined for $1\leq x \leq 3$. Given the second property of $f$, the function is symmetric around $x = 2$ when considered as a function of $1\leq x \leq 3$. This symmetry implies that to find the smallest $x$ such that $f(x) = f(2001)$, we can find the $x$ value in the same interval.

## Step 4: Utilize the symmetry property to narrow down the possible x values
Since $2001$ is much larger than $3$, we only need to find the relationship of $f(x)$ with respect to $f(2001)$ in the interval $1\leq x \leq 3$.

## Step 5: Find the value of f(2001) in terms of the given function f
Using the given property $f(3x) = 3f(x)$, we can express $f(2001)$ as $f(2001) = f(667\cdot 3) = 3f(667)$. Since $667$ is close to $2001$, we can assume $667$ satisfies the given equations $f(667) = 1- |667 - 2|\leq 3f(667) = 1- |667 - 2|$.

## Step 6: Recognize the equalities between x = 667 and f(x) and the required value
We must evaluate f(667). Using the property f(3x) = 3f(x), we find that f(2001) = 3f(667) = 3f(667). Since the first part of the given interval for f is $1\leq x \leq 3$, the value of f(667) is given by f(2001) = f(667).

## Step 7: Determine the value of f(667) based on the equality of the two parts of the function
Substituting the value of $f(667)$ as $1 - |667 - 2|$.

## Step 8: Solve for x
Set $1 - |667-2|\ =\ 1- |667-2|$. The first value from the left is from the first case within the interval for which the function f has its given equation, i.e., x is in the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 3. So, we need to calculate |667 - 2| = |665| = 665. Then, equate the two sides: $1-665=\ 1-665$. So, the value of $x$ is $\frac{1}{3}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Understand the given properties of the function f(x)
The function $f(x)$ is defined such that $f(3x) = 3f(x)$ for all positive real values of $x$. Additionally, the function is periodic with the property $f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|$ for $1 \leq x \leq 3$.

## Step 2: Determine the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the function f(x)
We can start by considering different intervals of the domain of x and finding the corresponding outputs of f(x). For $1 \leq x \leq 3$, $f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|$. Let's choose $x = 1$ and $x = 2$ to find the general form of the function in this interval.

## Step 3: Find the outputs for x = 1 and x = 2
When $x = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1 - |1 - 2| = 1 - | -1| = 2$. When $x = 2$, we have $f(2) = 1 - |2 - 2| = 1 - |0| = 1$.

## Step 4: Express the output of f(x) for x > 3
Using the property $f(3x) = 3f(x)$ for all positive real $x$, we can express $f(x)$ as $f(x) = f(3 \cdot \frac{x}{3}) = 3f(\frac{x}{3})$ for $x > 3$. We can then consider $x = \frac{x}{3}$ and find the general form of the function in the interval (3, 3x).

## Step 5: Find the outputs for x = x/3
When $x = \frac{x}{3}$, we have $f(\frac{x}{3}) = 1 - |\frac{x}{3} - 2| = 1 - |\frac{x}{3} - \frac{6}{3}| = 1 - |\frac{x}{3} - 2|$.

## Step 6: Combine the outputs of x > 3
Combining the expressions for $x > 3$, we get $f(x) = 3 - f(3 \cdot \frac{x}{3})$ for $x > 3$ and $f(x) = f(\frac{x}{3}) = 1 - |\frac{x}{3} - 2|$ for $1 \leq x \leq 3$.

## Step 7: Find the smallest x for which f(x) = f(2001)
To find the smallest x for which $f(x) = f(2001)$, we need to consider both intervals of the function and find the equality for the minimum value. Since the function is periodic and we can see that 2001 is much greater than the intervals' end value, we consider $f(2001) = 1 - |2001 - 2|$.

## Step 8: Calculate the outputs for x > 3 and solve the equation
Since we want $f(2001) = 1 - |2001 - 2|$ so that the function value of $f(2001)$ will lie in $[1,-1]$ then $|2001-2|$ must be in $[0,3]$.

## Step 9: Determine the range for the absolute value of 2001 - 2 between 0 and 3
The absolute value of $2001 - 2$ is in the range $(1,3)$ because $2001 - 2$ is negative.
Using the function definition we find the smallest value for 2001 will be when $x$ is its closest integer multiple:

Generated completion: To solve the given functional equation $f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|$, note the following:

Since $f(1 \leq x \leq 3$, $f(x) = 1 - (x-2) = 3 - x$.

Since $f(x)$ is increasing, $f(3) = 1-3=-2$, and $f(x) = 1-x$ for $x \geq 2$.

$2001 < 4$.
Note $f(x)$ is increasing in the range.

The function is symmetric about $x=1.5$. By symmetry, we know that $f(x)=f(-1.5)$. Therefore, the smallest number $x$ for which $f(x) = f(2001)$ is $x = -1.5.$

So, setting x to 2001 and x being a multiple of 3 (with the exception of 2001 itself), the function f(x) is always equal to 3 times f(1/3). Let the original function be in the form of $$f\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)=3f\left(\frac{x}{3}\right).$$

The original function for x=3: $$f(3)=1-2=3f\left(\frac{3}{3}\right) \implies f(3)=1-3f(1)=1-3(-2)=7.$$ Since the equation now is $$f(x)=3f(1/x),$$ we can plug in x=1 to get $$f(1) = 3f(1/1)=3f(1)=3.$$ So, the function is $$f(x)=3+x.$$
The question is to find the smallest $x$ for which $f(x)=f(2001)$.

Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the variables for the given problem
Let S be the total number of students, F be the number of students studying French, and B be the number of students studying both Spanish and French.

## Step 2: Formulate the inequalities for the total number of students studying Spanish
Since there are 2001 students in total and 80% study Spanish, we have the inequality: 0.8 * S ≤ 2001.

## Step 3: Formulate the inequalities for the total number of students studying French
Since there are 2001 students in total and 30% study French, we have the inequality: 0.3 * S ≤ 2001.

## Step 4: Simplify the inequalities for Spanish and French study numbers
Simplifying the inequalities, we get S ≤ 2001 / 0.8 = 2525 and S ≥ 2001 / 0.3 = 6667.

## Step 5: Find the range of B for the case when S studies only Spanish
To find the maximum B, let's denote the number of students studying French as x, the total number of students studying French is 2001. Then, x ≤ 2001 / 0.7. So the number of students who study Spanish (S) is given by S = x + B = 2001 - B.

## Step 6: Find the minimum value for B using 80% of 2001 students study Spanish
To find the minimum value for B, let's denote the number of students studying Spanish as x, then the number of students who study French (x) is between 2001 - 80% of 2001, i.e. 2001 - 1600 = 401.

## Step 7: Calculate the minimum number of students who must study both languages, let's call it m
m = 401 + B = 2001

## Step 8: Find the maximum value for B
Since S = 2001 - B, the maximum value for B equals 2001 - 2525 = -524.

## Step 9: Calculate the maximum number of students who study both languages, let's call it M
The maximum number M equals 2001 - B = 2001 - 529 = 1482


## Step 10: Find the difference between M and m
The difference between the largest and smallest number who study both languages is given by the equation M - m = 1482 - 401.

## Step 11: Final arithmetic for the difference between M and m
1482 - 401 = 1081
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the variables
Let $S$ be the total number of students studying Spanish, $F$ be the total number of students studying French, and let $M$ be the number of students studying both languages.

## Step 2:  Determine constraints for each variable
Since there are 2001 students in total, we have the constraints:
$S + F - M = 2001$,
$S + (S - M) > 80\%$, and
$F + (F - M) > 40\%$.

## Step 3:  Express constraints as inequalities
$S > 0.8*2001$, $S < 2001 + 0.4$, and $F > 0.4*2001$.

## Step 4: Calculate the range for Spanish
The minimum number of students studying Spanish is $1600.8$ and the maximum is $2001$. So the minimum number of students studying only Spanish is $4001 - 2001$ and the maximum is $2000$.

## Step 5: Calculate the range for French
The minimum number of students studying French is $800$ and the maximum is $2001 - 0.6 * 2001$.

## Step 6: Determine the minimum and maximum values for M
Therefore, the minimum value of $M$ is 2000 since it is the maximum number that can be subtracted from the total students, and the maximum value of $M$ is $1600.8 - 1600$ because the number of students studying both languages cannot be greater than the number studying either language.

## Step 7: Find the values of M and m
It follows that $M = 1600.8- 1600 =0.8$ and $M=2000$. Thus, $M-m= 2000 - 0.8 =1999.2$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1999.2}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Calculate the minimum number of students studying Spanish.
We know that 80% of 2001 students study Spanish, so the minimum number of students studying Spanish is $0.8 \times 2001 = 1600.8$, which we round up to 1601 because the number of students must be an integer.

## Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of students studying Spanish.
We also know that 85% of 2001 students study Spanish, so the maximum number of students studying Spanish is $0.85 \times 2001 = 1700.85$, which we round down to 1700 because the number of students must be an integer.

## Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of students studying French.
We know that 30% of 2001 students study French, so the minimum number of students studying French is $0.3 \times 2001 = 600.3$, which we round up to 601.

## Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of students studying French.
We also know that 40% of 2001 students study French, so the maximum number of students studying French is $0.4 \times 2001 = 800.4$, which we round down to 800.

## Step 5: Calculate the minimum number of students studying both languages.
Let $m$ be the smallest number of students who could study both languages, denoted by $m = n_1$, we want to maximize n. If there are $(n_1 + n_2)$ students who study both, with $n_1$ studying Spanish and $n_2$ studying French, then the sum of the number studying Spanish and the number studying French, minus the number of students studying both, equals $(n_1 + n_2) - (n_1 - n_2) = 2n_2$, and the sum of the number of students studying Spanish and the number studying French, minus the number of students studying both, must divide 2001. Thus 1700 + 601 - m and 1601 + 800 - m should be divisible by m, the least common multiple should be equal to 2001. Therefore we find the range in m which can have a common divisor of 2001.

## Step 6: Solve for m and find the biggest possible number of students who could study both languages.
First, determine potential factors of 2001 which are relevant here since we know our answer is divisible by both n_1 + n_2, which has to be between 1700 and 800 to be in the same parity as m so it is odd. Also we're looking for the smallest prime factors possible as the minimum value of m could be when the numbers can share as little as possible between both the languages. Therefore let 2001= 17 * 118 using trial and error or other methods. As Spanish is also less than French at least for every one and only every one of the factor pair of 2001 can have the potential number studying both. Therefore, 118 is the only possibility for French, which represents the total number who could study both as it has to satisfy the inequality conditions: it is greater than French and lower than the minimum study Spanish as well.
So, $M = 118$

## Step 7: Calculate the minimum and maximum number of students studying both languages (M and m).
The minimum being minimum of both sets that satisfy all conditions which is 118 and M is also the maximum which is less than 2001. Therefore $M - m$ is calculated by M - m = 118 - 118 = 0.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Define the variables for the number of students studying Spanish or French, and the number of students studying both languages.
Let's denote the number of students studying Spanish as S, the number of students studying French as F, and the number of students studying both languages as B. We're given that the number of students studying Spanish is between 80% and 85% of the school population, T, and the number of students studying French is between 30% and 40% of T.

## Step 2: Express the number of students studying Spanish and French using the given information.
We can express the number of students studying Spanish as S = 0.8T and the number of students studying French as F = 0.3T.

## Step 3: Consider the condition that S and F cannot be zero since the total number of students studying either Spanish or French cannot exceed the total population of the school.
Since S + F cannot exceed 2001 (the total number of students in the school), (S + F) ≤ 2001. Substituting the values of S and F from step 2, we have (0.8T + 0.3T) ≤ 2001.

## Step 4: Solve for T to find the range of the total percentage of students studying either Spanish or French.
Solving the inequality from step 3, we have 1.1T ≤ 2001, so T ≤ 2001 / 1.1 ≈ 1818.45...  Therefore, T is at most 1818.

## Step 5: Find the maximum possible values of S and F, then the minimum possible values of B.
The maximum value of B, assuming that B ≤ 2001, is obtained when T approaches 2001 from below. So, F = 0.3(2001) = 601. B = 0.8(2001) = 1600.8, which is an integer, so B = 1600.

## Step 6: Calculate the minimum possible value of B, as the smallest value of B should also be an integer, then the minimum number of students studying both languages, which is m, and the maximum possible value of B, which is the largest number of students studying both languages, which is M.
To eliminate B from the equation S = 0.8T and knowing the maximum possible value for T, we realize T = S + 600.5, so we have S = T - 600.5. The minimum possible value of B should be m, when  S is 0. Then 0.8T = 1600.5, which gives 10B = 8005 and thus B = 800.5. Given values for S should be slightly lower and higher than 160, S will vary between 1508 and 1519, in order to decrease B. So, the minimum value for the number of the minimum B = 1508. Therefore M will be m = S + B = 3006, and so, M = 3006 - 1508 = 1498.

## Step 7: Calculate M - m.
M - m = 1498 - 1508.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-10}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of the number of students who study Spanish and French.
First, let's state the given conditions for the number of students studying Spanish and French. The number of students studying Spanish is between 80% of the total school population and can be given as 80% of 2001, which is $0.8 \times 2001 = 1600.8$. Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round to 1601 students. Similarly, the number of students studying French is between 30% of the total school population and can be given as 30% of 2001, which is $0.3 \times 2001 = 600.3$. Again, rounding to a whole number, the number of students studying French is 600 students.

## Step 2:  Now, we need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for the number students studying both languages, denoted as $m$ and $M$ respectively.
To find the minimum value of $m$, we need to find the maximum possible number of students who study only Spanish. This can be done by subtracting the total number of students studying Spanish (which is 1601) from the total number of students (which is 2001). So, $m=2001-1601=400$.

## Step 3:  To find the maximum value of $M$, we need to find the minimum possible number of students who study both languages, denoted as $m$.
The minimum number of students studying both languages is attained when the number of students studying Spanish and French are as close as possible but still within the given boundaries. Therefore, the minimum value of $M$ will occur when the number of students studying Spanish is the minimum (1601). Then, the number studying French will be 600, as these are the lowest possible numbers within the given boundaries.

## Step 4:  Finally, we want to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is given by the expression $M-m$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Calculate the possible number of students studying Spanish
Let's start by determining the range of the number of students studying Spanish. Since 80% of 2001 students is between 1600.8 and 1700.8, we round these values up to the nearest whole number, getting 1601 and 1700. This accounts for 80 percent to 85 percent of the students. Therefore, the range for the number of students studying Spanish is between 1601 and 1700, inclusive.

## Step 2: Calculate the possible number of students studying French
Next, we calculate the range of the number of students studying French. Considering 30% of 2001 students is between 606.3 and 601.3, we round these values down to the nearest whole number, getting 606 and 600. This accounts for 30 percent to 40 percent of the students. Therefore, the range for the number of students studying French is between 606 and 600, inclusive.

## Step 3: Calculate the range for students studying both languages
Now, let's determine the range for students studying both languages. The largest number studying both can be found by taking the smallest upper limit in the Spanish and the smallest upper limit in the French, minus the smallest common number since those who study both should be counted twice, and the smallest possible value is the smaller of the two limits: $m = min(1601, 606) - min(608, 600) = 1601 - 600 = 601$ and the largest number is $M = max(1700, 606) - max(1600, 600) = 1700 - 600 = 1100$.

## Step 4: Find the range for the difference M-m
To find $M-m$, we subtract $m$ from $M$: $M-m = 1100 - 601$.

## Step 5: Perform the final subtraction to find the difference
$M - m = 1100 - 601 = 499$.


The final answer is: $\boxed{499}$

Let $S$ be the number of students studying Spanish, $F$ be the number of students studying French, and $S \cap F$ be the number of students studying both.

## Step 2: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to express the total number of students studying either Spanish or French or both.
The formula for inclusion-exclusion is $N = S + F - S \cap F$. We are given that the percentage of students studying Spanish is between 80 percent and 85 percent, which translates to $0.8N \leq S \leq 0.85N$, and the percentage of students studying French is between 30 percent and 40 percent, which translates to $0.3N \leq F \leq 0.4N$.

## Step 3: Express S and F using the given constraints and derive a range for S and F.
Solving for S, we get $S = 0.8N$ and solving for F, we get $F = 0.3N$. Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get $N = 0.8N + 0.3N - S \cap F$.

## Step 4: Substitute S and F into the inclusion-exclusion formula to find the range for $S \cap F$.
We know that $N = 2001$. Substituting, we get $2001 = 1.1N - S \cap F$. We need to find the range for $S \cap F$.

## Step 5: Solve the inequality to find the range of S and F for the minimum and maximum number of students studying both languages.
To find the range for $S \cap F$, we solve the inequality $1.1N - S \cap F \geq 2001$ and $S \cap F \geq 0.8N - 2001$ and $S \cap F \leq 0.3N - 2001$. After solving for S and F, we find that the minimum possible value for $S \cap F$ is 499 and the maximum is 1509.

## Step 6: Calculate the value of $M$ and $m$ and find the difference $M - m = M$.
The total possible combinations of S and F that satisfy the two inequalities is a square of integer from 499 to 1509, since both are integers.
To get the range of possible combinations for S = Scap F and both numbers have an integer value. So that M = 1509 and $m$ = 499

The final answer is: $\boxed{{1000}}$
Generated completion: ## Step 1: First, let's calculate the range of the number of students who study Spanish.
The number of students who study Spanish can be represented as $S = 0.8x$, where $x$ is the total number of students.

## Step 2: Next, let's calculate the range of the number of students who study French.
The number of students who study French can be represented as $F = 0.3y$, where $y$ is the total number of students.

## Step 3: To find the range of the number of students who study both languages, we need to consider that either A or both A and B are true, which is represented by the given range 80% to 85% and between 30% to 40% or both A and B are true.
Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can represent the range of the number of students who study both languages as S ∩ F = (S + F) - 2001. We know S and F, so we have
$$ 0.8x + 0.3y - 2001 = n = S + F
$$ or
$$ (0.8x + (0.3y - 2001) - (0.8x + (0.3y - 2001)) = (2001)
$$.
## Step 4: Then use the given ranges of S, x, and F. Since the middle value x must be somewhere in between, we have (S + F) = 0.8x + 0.3y = 2001.
## Step 5: We first solve for y in the equation from Step 4: y = 2100 / 0.7 - 0.3x = 3000 / 0.7 - 0.3x/ 0.7 = 3000/0.7 - 21.42857142857x).
## Step 6: Then find lower and upper bounds for M (the smallest number who study both) and upper bounds for M (the largest who study both). The range for S is from 400 to 1570 (100% - 80%) and the range for F is from 300 to 600 (30% - 10%). Then use the inclusion-exclusion principle A∩B = (S∪F)-A (the value for M), where we get for (∪F) = 4100, A = 600 and ∪S = 1570.
## Step 7: Plug the bounds into the formula for A∩S, A∪S, and A∪F from step 6.
## Step 8: (4100 - (600) = number in S union A ∪ S)= 3500, (1570 - 600, = number in S ∪ B)= 917.

Generated completion: <think> In this case, we can see that ABC is an isosceles triangle because AB = $AB$. Then, angle A = angle C, so they are congruent. Now we have triangle ABC is equilateral because angle A = C = 45^{\circ}, then all angles are 60^{\circ}. The Law of Cosines then tells us that BC = $r$ because cosine of angle ABC is equal to the square root of 3. Since D is on the arc BC, the triangle also is isosceles.

$HDP$ is sharing $\angle HCP$, and $HAN$ and $AD$ are corresponding angles,
We have that $DP \parallel PC$, so $AP \parallel BP$. The angle between the altitudes is right. $\measuredangle APD = \measuredangle APC$. Furthermore, since $BN=CM$ it follows that $PN=PC$. Thus, the ratios of the sides of $\triangle HCP$ and $\triangle ADN$ are the same. In other words, we have that $HN=HN$, i.e., $N$ is the midpoint
of $DC$, and $\bigtriangleup HCN \sim \bigtriangleup APN$. Since $\bigtriangleup AHN$ is right and $PN\perp BC$ we have that $NH\perp BC$. Also, since $BM=CM$, it follows that $NH=MC$, and $HP = HC$, and $HA=HC$. Thus, we have that $CN = CP$. Therefore, we can see that $\triangle CPH$ is an isosceles triangle with $CP$ as the base. Therefore, we can conclude $CP = CH = HA$.
Also since $AC=\tan30^{\circ} = \sqrt{3}$
and therefore $\overline{PH}$ is the median of $\bigtriangleup HAC$, by Apollonius' Theorem, we can conclude that
 $AP^2= AH ^2+PH^2= HA^2 +2 \cdot PH^2=5+2(3)$

Since  the triangle is isosceles, angles $B, M$, and  $\angle A$ are all equal.  Therefore $\angle CHM$ and  $\angle HMN$ are congruent. Therefore,  the  right triangles $\triangle APN$ and $\triangle ACH$ are congruent. Therefore  the  corresponding  legs  of  $\triangle ACH$  and  $\triangle AHP$ are congruent.

Since these triangles are congruent since $AHCDP$ is a rectangle, $AP$ must bisect $\angle HPB$. Therefore, let $HP=x$. Since $AP=\frac {2HP}{3} $, we obtain $AP = \frac{2x}{3}$. This simplifies to $36 = \frac{x^2}{9}$. Solving for x yields $x=6$, so $AP=\frac{12}{3}=4$. Therefore, $AN=PM=x, PN=x$. Therefore, $\triangle PNA\sim\triangle PAC$. By the relationship of similar triangles, $AP^2=A\_N^2+N\_P^2=PAP^2$. Simplifying this using the fact that $AN = PM = 6$, we get $1926=36+36 \Rightarrow \boxed{AP^2=\frac{1932}{37}.}$

<hthink> Tangent $BD$ bisects $\angle BAC$, therefore, $\measuredangle ABD=\measuredangle BAC=\measuredangle C=45^{\circ}.$ Because the altitude $\widehat{AH}$ bisects $\angle BAC$, then  $\widehat{HBD}=\widehat{ADB}=\big(180^{\circ}-90^{\circ}-45^{\circ}\big)=45^{\circ}$. Therefore $ABD$ is an isosceles. Therefore,  $\overline{BH}=DH=HM$.

Since $BM=CM$,  then $MH=HD$. So $\overline{DM}=\overline{MH}$.

From $\triangle BDP \sim \triangle HCD$, we get:

$$\frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{HB}{HD} = \frac{DH}{HP}$$

Therefore, we can solve for DH:
$$\mbox{In } \triangle BDP \sim \triangle HCD, \frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{DH}{HP}$$. From the triangle $ABD$, the base is $BD = 10$, the side opposite the 30-60-90 triangle is $4$, and since $BM = CM = HM$, we can solve for the other side of the isosceles triangle:
$$H = DH = \frac{HP}{2 }$$
Since BP is the median to the base of the right triangle BDP,
$$BP = \frac{DP }{2}.$$ Then, we have that
$$H = DH = \frac{DH}{2} = \frac{HP}{6}$$. Since $\angle HDP = \angle HCD$,  then $PD = CD $. This is also equal to HD. Thus, since $HD = DH = DHP, \overline{HD}=\frac{1}{3}\cdot 10$
From the Pythagorean Theorem we have
$$(AD)^2 = BD^2+HC^2 $$
Using the ratios established earlier, we have
$$(\frac{1}{3}\cdot 10)^2 = 4^2 + (DH)^2$$
Therefore,
$$(\frac{1}{3}\cdot 10)^2=10^2+\frac{1}{7}\cdot10^2$$
This gives
$$\frac{100}{9} = \frac{100}{7}$$
But it's given that $AP^2=\text{frac}{100}{9}$, so answer is $100+7=107$.

Generated completion: <think> The process of solving this problem starts with thinking about even numbers and composing them from smaller parts. An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2. Odd numbers are integers that cannot be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. Composite numbers are those numbers that have more than two factors.

Think about it: any number that can be expressed as the sum of two numbers, one odd and one even, would be even. So, we need to find an even number that cannot be expressed in this way. Now, any number that is the sum of two odd numbers, both being composite (to keep it composite), will be odd. Since 2 + 2 = 4, which is an even number, we can include 4 and other similar situations where a 2 is the additive component.
Generated completion: think> The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Two odd composite numbers combined to form an integer can either be a power of 2 and another even number, or an integer of the form n(n+1) that is not a power of 2, or an even number of 2's, multiplied by 3 or 5. Since a larger and larger number greater than 12 will either be a power of 2, or 3 times a power of 2, or a multiple of 5 times an even number, we only have to keep an eye out for any number that can be broken down into a power of 2 and an odd number. We have to find a large odd number n such that 2^n is less than the sum of the possible odd composite numbers.  The sum of two 3s is 9. The sum of the two 5's is 10. The sum of an even number of multiples of 2 is an even number. When we add 2 + 5 = 7, and get the largest even integer that cannot be written as the sum of two odd composite numbers, we get the answer 8.
Generated completion: <think> The problem can be approached by using a basic understanding of the properties of even and composite numbers. An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. To tackle this problem, we can start by listing down the possible sums of pairs of odd composite numbers to understand which combinations do not yield an even number.

For instance, adding two odd numbers yields an odd number which is the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers that do not yield another odd number, which is still even. The composite numbers in this range include 4, 6, 8, 9, etc., up to 25.

Considering these properties, let's find two odd composite numbers whose sum is even. The pairs include (9, 7) - 9 + 7 = 16; (10, 4) - 10 + 4 = 14; and (12, 6) - 12 + 6 = 18; (14, 8) - 14 + 8 = 22. For all pairs of even composite numbers, the sum tends to be an even number.

Now, from these pairs it becomes apparent that the only possible options that can yield an odd sum are the 1. As there are no even numbers between 9 and 25 that can sum to the number 1. Therefore, the largest possible even integer that cannot be written as the sum of two odd composite numbers is 1.
Generated completion: <think> The first step is to recall the definition of an odd composite number. An odd composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than one or itself. Now, think about the sum of two odd numbers. It is always even.

<answer> The largest even number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd composite numbers is 30.  Since 30 is already even, 30 = 19 + 11 and 30 is not even, only if one can find two odd composite numbers whose sum is 30.
Generated completion: <think> The problem mentions even numbers, since we need to find the largest integer, and even numbers are multiples of 2, and we can represent odd numbers as 2 + 2k where k is an integer, the odd composite numbers are 3, 5, 9, 15, etc. Since the numbers in question, have to be sums of two  odd composite numbers, they need to be of the form 24, 30, 42, 56, 90 etc. To get the largest even number, we should look for maximum possible number of factors of which it has to be divisible. Here is the thinking process</think>

<answer>  The number 10 can be written as 3 + 7 and 16 + 4  thus, it is not a sum of two  odd composite numbers. But, 8 can be written as 5 + 3. Therefore, we have the answer 16
Generated completion: <think> When we need to find an even number that is not the sum of two other even numbers, we can start by trying different combinations of even numbers.
The even integers below 20 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. We can check which of these numbers can be made as a sum by adding two even numbers.
For example, 6 can be made as 8+2 and 10+4, both of which are odd, so 6 cannot be written as the sum of two other even numbers. However, 18 can be made as 14+4 and 16+2. This means 18 is a sum.
17 can only be made as 16+1, which is an odd number.
Therefore, numbers like 18, 16, and 14 are also sums. We continue checking the next multiples of 2 below 18:

Generated completion: Let's think about this problem.

To solve this problem, let's use the symmetry of the situation and the fact that the probability that Terry and Mary pick the same color candies is the same regardless of which two candies Terry picks first.

We think that there are ${20 \choose 2}=190$ ways for Terry to pick 2 red candies, and ${20 \choose 2}=190$ ways for Mary to pick 2 blue candies, giving a total of $190\cdot 190 = 36400$ ways for them to pick 4 candies.

Next, we think that Terry picks two of the 10 red and two of the 10 blue candies. The number of ways that Terry can pick 2 red candies is ${10\choose 2}=45$, and the number of ways that Mary can pick 2 blue candies is also 45, resulting in $45 \cdot 45=2025$ ways for them to pick these two, for some total of $2025 + 36400 = 38425$ ways to pick 4 candies.

However, there are many possible pairs that Terry and Mary can pick. Terry can pick both red candies in ${10\choose 2}=45$ ways and both blue candies in ${10\choose 2}=45$ ways, for a total of ${10\choose 2}({10\choose 2}= 225$ for both red and blue.

Since they can pick any of the remaining 10 each for red and blue pairs with each other, and they each have 75 of these pairs for each color. Therefore, the probability is ${25\choose 2}({25\choose 2} = \frac{25\cdot 24}{2} = 300.$ This can be simplified to $\boxed{319}$
Generated completion: <think> The total number of ways to pick 4 candies can be calculated as ${20 \choose 4}$. Since we want to find the ways in which two pick up both red candies and other two pick up different colored candies, we have ${20 \choose 2}{10 \choose 2}=2100$. Thus the number of successful cases is ${10 \choose 2}{10 \choose 2}=210$.
The number of such cases in which both of the second pick candies are the same color is 5 (2 red * 5 red choose 2) + 5 blue*5 blue choose 2. And there are 5 such cases where the first two candies are red; and there are 5 such cases for blue. Hence the total cases of same color are $5+5+5+5=20.$ So the probability of event B (Both pick same color candies) is $$\frac{20}{210}=\frac{2}{21}$$ Since the problem is for only event B to happen, P (B) =2/21 and total number of ways = 210. Now probability of other event A is P(A) = $1 - P(B)$. So probability of event A = $1-\frac{2}{21}=\frac{19}{21}$. There are 10 choose 2 = 10 * 9/2 = 45 ways in which the first two candies are blue. So the number of ways in which other 4 candies are blue is ${9 \choose 2}=36$. Hence the total cases in which the first two candies are blue = 45*36 = 1620. So the probability of event B' (the first two candies are blue but other two are not red)$$\frac{1620}{210} = \frac{162}{210} = \frac{3}{5}$$and probability of event B'' (the first two candies are blue but other two are red)$$\frac{1}{210}.$$ So Probability of event B+B'' is $$\frac{3}{5}+\frac{1}{210}=\frac{151}{210}.$$ Also probability of event A+B$ $=$ probability of event B+A$$\frac{19}{21}+\frac{3}{5}=\frac{171}{105}$$So $\displaystyle \frac{\frac{171}{105}}{\frac{151}{210}}=2$$So the answer is $$\boxed{313}.$
Generated completion: <think> To solve this problem, we'll first find the probability that the pickings leave both Terry and Mary with the same color. There are nine red candies and ten blue ones left, out of a total of $20 \cdot 19 = 380$ ways to pick two candies, so the probability that they both pick red candies is  ${20\choose2}/\binom{380}{2} = {190/95}$. The probability that the two of them both pick blue candies is also ${20/101 \choose 2}/\binom{380}{2} = {190/95}$. Thus, the probability that they pick the same color is $(\frac{190}{95})^2 = \frac{36100}{9025}$.

Therefore, the probability of Terry and Mary getting a matching color combination = $\frac{2*C(20,2)}{C(20,2)*C(20,2)} = \frac{2*19*18}{2*19*18} = 1$.

If m is divisible by 5, we have the equation c_{1}n+1 = (200)(999)/(m), where 0 ≤ c_1 ≤ m -1. If m is not divisible by 5, we have the equation c_1n +1= (200)(999)/(m).
## Step 5: Step 5 description
Since c_1 must be odd and in the interval [1, n - 1], it follows that 601 ± 1 are both even, so it must be that 601 is odd. Let m =5 and n =5; 2000 - 1099 = 901 is a multiple of 200, and 999 is a multiple of 200.

## Step 6: Step 6 description
Since m and n are both greater than 1, we know that m and n cannot equal 5. Let m = 5 + k*5, and then n = 5 + m - 5 = k.

## Step 7: Step 7 description
The given condition can also be expressed as (c_1n + 1) = 901/(m). So we get n = (901*m)/(200 + 5), which can be simplified to n = (180*m + 1)/35. Since m is odd, 180*m can only take values of the form 9*a + 2 for some integer a, as 180 = 2*90 and a can only take the values 1, 2,..., 8.

## Step 8: Step 8 description
We can substitute 180*m = 9*a + 2 into n = (180*m + 1)/35 to get n = 9 + 35/a. For m = 5, we can substitute n = 5 + m - 5 = k into the above equation to get 9 + 35/k = 5 - 5 =0. Solving, we find that there are 0 positive solutions for k.

## Step 9: Step 9 description
Since m is odd, 1 ≤ k < 8 and k must be even for n to be an integer. For all positive values of k, the equation 9 + 35/k is between 11 and 37. By plotting the numbers, only the values that are less than 11 are taken, yielding k = 6.

The first thing $m$ and $n$ can be is the difference between $n$ and $2000$, since the line through $200$ and the line through $2000$ intersects inside the unit square $1099$, and $1099$ is the largest difference that can be squared:

<answer> $n-2000$ and $m-200$ can take on the values of $1,3,5,\dots $</answer>
Generated completion: ## Step 1: Understand the setup of the problem
The problem describes a rectangle made of unit squares where the top row has numbers from 1 to $n$, the second row has numbers from $n + 1$ to $2n$, and so on, and square $200$ is in the top row and square $2000$ is in the bottom row. The line through the centers of squares $200$ and $2000$ intersects the interior of square $1099$.

## Step 2: Analyze the conditions for intersection
To find the number of ordered pairs $(m,n)$ satisfying the condition, we need to understand the conditions for the line to intersect the interior of square $1099$. The line through the centers of squares $200$ and $2000$ can be expressed as $\frac{x}{2}(x - 1000) = 0$ and $\frac{y}{2}(y - 500) = 0$. This simplifies to $x = 1000$ or $y = 500$.

## Step 3: Find the condition for the line intersecting the interior of square $1099$
Since the line x = 1000, this means that the center square above it must be a perfect square or have a center square above it. The side $(m-1)n$ of the $m \times n$ rectangle has the condition $(m+999) + 1 > m$ and $ (m + 999) < (m + 1) + 1. Let us look at  $9 \le q < 31$ (we assume that the line can get between the points of the rectangle).
Generated completion: <think> The line through the centers of squares 200 and 2000 intersects the interior of square 1099, which is the product of two squares from the 1st and 5th quadrants of their respective coordinate planes. This implies that the difference between the $x$-coordinates of the centers of squares 200 and 1099 must be odd, which implies $m-n+1=2k+1,$ or $m-n=2k+1$. Since the difference between the $y$-coordinates of the centers of squares 200 and 1099 must be even, since 2000 is far from 1099, the difference between the $y$-coordinates of their centers must be $2m+n$. We need to find the possible odd $n$ for which $2m+n$ is odd, as well. In particular, we must let $m=2k+1$ and find the possible values of $k$ such that $2(2k+1)+n$ is odd. We can then sum all the values of $k$ for which $2(2k+1)+n$ is odd, as well as all the possible $m$ for each of these $k$ values, as well as the corresponding values of $m$, $n $, and the $(m,n)$ pairs of $(m,n).$

<answer> There are $\left\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{2000^2 + 2001} - \sqrt{1099^2 - 2000^2}}{\sqrt{2}} \right\rfloor + 1$ possibilities for $k$ when calculating $m$ from $2(2k+1)+n$, for each odd $n<2001$. We can then add $\sqrt{2000^2 + 2001}$  to  $200$ because $\left| \lfloor \frac{\sqrt{2000^2 + 2001-2000^2}{\sqrt{2}} \right| + \sqrt{2000^2 + 2001} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left|4 \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \sqrt{2000^2 + 2001} \right\rfloor + 1.$ Then subtracting 1999 from the given result will give us the final answer.

<answer> There are $\left\lfloor \sqrt{2000^2 + 2001} - \sqrt{1099^2 - 2000^2} \right\rfloor + 1$ possible odd values of $n$ for which $2(2k+1)+n$ is odd, for each odd $k$ such that $2(2k+1)>2001.$ We can then sum all the possible values of $k$. We can calculate the difference between $\sqrt{2000^2 + 2003} - \sqrt{1099^2 - 2000^2}$ and then take its $\lfloor$ value. We can then add 2000 to that and 1 to get our final answer

Note that the left inequality gives $m \le \sqrt{1077}$. The left inequality is always true if $m$ and $n$ are greater than or equal to $28$, since $n^2 \ge 1078.$ Therefore we assume $n \le 28.$ Now we substitute for $2m+n^2 = 1097$ into the first inequality to obtain $$\sqrt{1077} m \le 1097-1 $ $m^2 (m-28) \le 1080$. We have that 1080 is divisible by 27; in other words, 1080 is divisible by 9 squared (which is 81) and 120. Since we are told that $m$ is odd, we must have $$m^2 (m-28) \le 81.$$ Since we also know that $m \le \sqrt{1077}$  the maximum possible value of $m$ is 105. Therefore we can test all values in the range $n\le 28$ and for each value of $n$ (with $n=1$ to 28) and for each odd value of $m>31$ if the inequality $m^2(m-28) \le 81$ holds to see if it is true. Since there are $9$ odd values for $m $ in the range $1\le m \le 105$ that make the inequality hold (since for any one of $m$, $m^2(m-28)$ is positive and then $m^2(m-28)$ becomes positive regardless of whether the value of  $m+  28 $ and $m- 28$ have the same sign), there are $9$ values for
Generated completion: <think> The centers of squares $200$ and $2000$ are separated by $\sqrt{200^2-199^2}=39.$ Since square $1099$ is also the center in the diagonal of the rectangle, and we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem, we know $9^2 + 1^2=200^2<2000$. The only possible order of $m,n$ is $(m,n)=(39,40),39,40,40,40,39,$ or $40$. The number of pairs of odd integers $(m,n)$ is $\boxed{2}$.
Generated completion: <think> We need to find the number of ordered pairs $(m,n)$ of odd integers greater than $1$ for which the line through the centers of squares $200$ and $2000$ intersects the interior of square $1099$, so in other words, intersections with the central square. We will first construct the rectangle with squares as $2n$.
Since the center of both squares $200$ and $2000$ are squares of length $m-1$, we need the length of the rectangle be at least $2n+1$ for the intersection to occur, so that the distance between $200$ and $2000$ are at least $2n$. This means $$2n+1>m\geq2n+1,$$ so the length must be minimum $2n+1$. Now we construct the rectangle $2n$ by $m-1$. Each of its $m-1$ squares can divide the center of each row in that rectangle in the two diagonals. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exist $q$ and $r$ ($q <m $ and $r <n$) such that the centers of the squares in the bottom row of the rectangle are divisible by $q$ and $r$, respectively. This implies that the $n$th square in the bottom row is divisible by both $q$ and $r$. Since both the $q$th and $r$th squares of the bottom row are divisible by $q$ and $r$, this implies that the $(n + 1)$th square in the bottom row is not divisible by $qr$, while the $(n + 2)$th and $(n+3)$th squares of the bottom row are divisible by $qr$. Since the first square in the bottom row is divisible by both $q$ and $r$, the $(n + 1)$th, $n+2$ the $(n+3)$th cannot be divisible by either $q$ or $r$. This means that the centers of the $n+1$th, $n+2$ the $(n+3)$th lie between the line segments $qr$. Therefore, the centers of these squares lie between $q(2n+1)$ and $qr+(m-1)$, and $q(2n+1)\leq (n + 1) \leq 2n+1$, so we get the inequalities $n\leq 2n+1$. This means n can only be two values, so we examine these two cases separately. Case $$1:\quad n=1$$  Since $1(m-1)=1099=2\cdot 2\cdot 59+1$. Since the centers of the squares of the first row are $1,3,5, \dots, 2n$ and $m-1$ of these squares are divisible by $1$. Since there are $m-1=1$ such squares, the number of possibilities when n = 1 is $1$$ (0 is excluded), and the total number of ordered pairs is $$\dbinom{m-1}{1}$$. Case$$2:\quad n=3$$ $$\dbinom{2(3}-1}{3-1}$$= $$\dbinom{5}{3} = 10.$$

Generated completion: <think>Let's first assume that the number of widgets produced by a worker in one hour is $\beta$ and the number of whoosits produced by a worker in one hour is $\gamma$, then</think>

Using the information given in the problem, we can set up equations based on the total production rates:

1. $100\beta + 200\gamma = 300$
2. $60\beta + 300\gamma = 240$
3. $150\beta + m\gamma = 150$

We can simplify and solve these equations to find the values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$.

<think>First, let's solve the first two equations together to eliminate $\gamma$.

 Divide the second equation by 2 to make the numbers of widgets and whoosits on both sides the same:
 $(30\beta + 150\gamma) / 2 = 120$

Multiply through by 2 to simplify:
 $30\beta + 150\gamma = 240$
Then subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate $\gamma$:
 $(30\beta + 150\gamma) - (100\beta + 200\gamma) = 240 - 300$
$30\beta - 50\gamma = 60$

Divide both sides by 5 to simplify:
 $6\beta - 10\gamma = 12$

Then we can rewrite the equation in terms of $\beta$ and $\gamma$:
 $\beta = \frac{12 + 10\gamma}6$

<think>

Set the expression for $\beta$ equal to the value of $\beta$ from the first equation to find $\gamma$:
$100\left(\frac{12 + 10\gamma}6\right) + 200\gamma = 300$
$100\left(2 + \frac{10\gamma}6\right) + 200\gamma = 300$
$200 (2 + \frac{10\gamma}6) + 200\gamma = 300$
$400 + \frac{2000\gamma}6 + 200\gamma = 300$
$\frac{2400\gamma}6 + \frac{2000\gamma}6 = 300 - 400$
$\frac{4400\gamma}6 = -100$
$\gamma = \frac{-100 \times 6}4400$
$\gamma = \frac{-600}4400$
$\gamma = \frac{-3}22$

<think>

Now that we know $\gamma$, we can solve for $\beta$:
$\beta = \frac{12 + 10(-3)}6$
$\beta = \frac{12-30}6$
$\beta = \frac{-18}6$
$\beta = -3$

<think>

Finally, we can solve for $m$ using the equation for $\beta$ and the value of $\gamma$:
$150\beta + m\gamma = 150$
$150(-3) + m(-3) = 150$

Combine like terms:
 $-450 - 3m = 150$
$3m = -600$
$m = -200$

So, the value of $m$ is -200.

first equation becomes:

x = 100/240
x = 1/2

First, let's define the rates at which the workers produce widgets and whoosits, denoted by $x$ and $y$ respectively. Then, we can establish the following system of equations representing the given production rates:

$\begin{align*}
100x = 300 &\ \rightarrow\ \implies\ \ x = 3 \\
60x = 240 &\ \rightarrow\ \implies\ \ x = 4

Since the equation for the second worker represents $x$ production rate in 1 hour, we can set $\frac{1}{3}$ as the x on the basis of given conditions for the first worker. Since $\frac{1}{3}$ is equivalent to the rate $4$.
Similarly, $\frac{1}{2}$ for the second worker is equivalent to the rate $x$ in first equation.

<answer> $\frac{4}{2} = 2$ </answer>
Generated completion: <think> First, let's analyze the problem by setting up a system of equations based on the information given. We know that the time and output (widgets and whoosits) change, so the relationship between the input times and outputs will change after that. Setting up equations for the first two situations gives:
- 100 workers produce 300 widgets in 1 hour, representing 300 widgets/hr
- 100 workers produce 200 whoosits in 1 hour, representing 200 whoosits/hr
<answer> 300 widgets/hr / 100 workers = 200 whoosits/hr / 100 workers = 1000 whoosits/hr
- In two hours, 60 workers can produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits
-
60 workers can produce 240 widgets in 2 hours, representing 240 widgets/hr
60 workers can produce 300 whoosits in 2 hours, representing 150 whoosits/hr
<think> Now, let's establish variables to denote output variables. W widgets and whosits from the first 2 equations.

<answer> The variables can be:
- W = 300 widgets/hr
- whosits/hr

Equations based on the first two scenarios:
60W = 240,  whosits = 300
<think> Simplify the equations. Dividing both equations by 60, respectively, gives us equations:
W = 240 / 60
whosits = 300 / 60

<answer> W = 4 whosits/hr
whosits = 5 whosits/hr

Consider that an "whoop" is equivalent to one whosits, for simplification, set
w = 1 whosits,
and solve for the time in whosits <think>

<answer> W = 4,  so the number of widgets per hour the worker should work
whosits/hr.
Since 300 widgets are produced in 60 whosits, we have 1 widget = 1/12whosits.
<think> In 4 whosits, we have 4 * 1/12 = 1/3 widgets.
For 60 whosits, we have 60 * 1/12
w = 5 whosits/hr

Considering the same logic as above, set the variables
whosits/hr
<answer> whosits/hr = 25 whosits/hr

Now we need to extend this logic in the 3rd scenario

In three hours, 50 workers can produce 130 widgets and m whoosits

<think> Using the result and ratios of whoosits/hour from the two previous scenarios, let's set up an equation to find the input (our whosits).
w*(1/12) = 250.

<answer> The equation of whosits/hr, w being in whosits/hr is w = m * 12 * 7

Solving the equations for w:
w*(4/12) = 120
we have   w = 120(12/4)

<answer> w = 360 whosits/hr

For whoosits, we substitute the value of w, and we have m = 12 *360
<answer> m = 4320



Now, we can find the final answer for'm'.
Generated completion: <think> We can apply the first piece of information to the first row to get, as there are 100 units of time and 300 items (widgets or whoosits) are produced in that one hour:
100 units of time \* each 100 widgets = 10,000 widgets
100 units of time \* each 200 whoosits = 20,000 whoosits
This means that the product of the time ratio and number of items ratio for widgets must be equivalent to x.  This gives the 0.1 for widgets 10,000 items = 6x,
0.2 for whoosits 20,000 items = 5x
Dividing the equation 20,000 / 10,000 for whoosits by the equation 20,000 / 20,000 to get the time ratio, which is 2/2 we get 1 for time ratio. Dividing the equation 1/ 0.2 for whoosits by the equation 0.2 for woosits we also get 0.1 as time ratio, so 6x / 5x = 1. This means the time ratio is 1:5
Next, we can apply this to the second piece of information to get that for two hours, 60 workers can produce $240$ widgets and 300 whoosits.  This is also equivalent to (60 two hours) = 60*two
0.1 two hours * 300 whoosits = 30 whoosits
Generated completion: The question states that 100 workers in one hour can produce 300 widgets and 200 whoosits.
Let's use the following set of equations to find the ratio of workers to widgets in one hour: (100 widgets) / (100 - ( widgets per unit time per worker))^1 = 300 / (100 - widgets per unit time per worker)^1
Let's simplify this equation:

Consider the left-hand side:
100 widgets / (n - ω1)}^1

Now consider the right-hand side:
300 / (n - ω1)^1
Where n is the number of widgets and ω1is the worker-hours per widget.
Generated completion: Let the constant production rate for widgets = $x$ and for whoosits = $y$.


Then, the production rate of widgets per hour = $ \dfrac{ 300   }{ 100  }$ and the 12 = 300   /40 =  x  2 = 6   $,
The production rate of whoosits per hour =   $\dfrac{ 200  }{ 100  }$ and   $\dfrac{ 300  }{120  }$ = 2   $,
Then we get ( 1 ) for widgets per hour = ($1, )  x rate worker hour and ($0.5) for whoosits per hour = ($0.6667).
(2 ) for widgets in 12 = 3x and (2 ) for whoosits in 3 hours = 0.8667 we see 12 x gives us the rate for widgets and using widget = 36  so the production rate for whoosits per hour is  $\dfrac{ 300  }{ 12   }$
Let's check the third one
